## Codefresh GitOps Cloud
Codefresh GitOps Cloud is a fully managed GitOps platform offering seamless environment promotions across clusters using your existing Argo CD. It extends GitOps principles beyond individual applications, providing a structured, scalable way to manage deployments of any size. 

## Codefresh GitOps Cloud for scalable, secure, and effortless Continuous Delivery
Application promotion between environments is often tedious, requiring extensive custom scripting and manual steps. With GitOps Cloud, you can easily create promotions by connecting multiple existing Argo CD instances to a single control plane—no additional software required.

Codefresh GitOps Cloud makes it fast and easy to promote software changes securely, giving teams full visibility and control over how applications move from development to production. No more managing clusters manually, no more disconnected scripts—just streamlined, automated delivery.

* **Multi-environment application promotions with Argo CD**
  No more custom scripts to manage environment promotion. Model environment promotion easily across clusters and runtimes. Group applications and microservices into products and logical environments that match how you actually deliver software.

* **Full visibility into your entire deployment**  
  Know exactly what’s running in each environment at a glance, across all clusters, at all times.

* **Full traceability from code to deployment**  
  Track the exact Git changes, pull requests, and issue-tracking events that led to each promotion, ensuring every deployment is auditable.

* **Scalable, standardized approach to GitOps**  
  Instead of managing promotions manually, teams get automated flows for predictable and repeatable deployments.
