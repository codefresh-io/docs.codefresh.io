  As IdPs come in all shapes and sizes, the following topic discusses in general what you must do to configure Federated SSO. 
  As you will see in the description below, the person in your organization responsible for managing your IdP will need to interact with Codefresh support team to successfully set up a trust between your IdP and Codefresh SP.

## Before you set up Federated SSO:
  1. Have your account set up with Codefresh enterprise plan.
  2. Ensure you have a working SAML 2.0 compliant Identity Provider (IdP).
  3. Identify someone in your organization who is familiar with configuring and managing your organization's IdP.
  4. Ensure that your IdP's system clock is synchronized with a reliable time source. If it is not, tokens generated will be unusable and SSO will fail.

## SAML Attributes

Codefresh expects the following user attributes to be passed through SAML between your Idp and Codefresh SP:
  - User email address
  - User first name
  - User last name
  - User full name
  - User unique ID that isn't subject to change in your identity management environment

## How does the connection process work?

Once Federated SSO has been configured, the process works as follows:

<div class="bd-callout bd-callout-info" markdown="1">
  Note

  Steps 2 to 7 happen in the background and are transparent to the user.
</div>

1. A user logs in to Codefresh and enters their email
2. The user is redirected to Codefresh Service Provider (SP) to initiate SSO.
3. The user’s browser is then redirected to the customer IdP.
4. Once authenticated by the corporate side, a SAML token is sent to the user’s browser.
5. The SAML assertion is then forwarded to Codefresh SP.
6. If you are a valid Codefresh user for this SSO connection, an SSO token is returned to the user’s browser.
7. The user’s browser then returns a token to Codefresh and access is granted for your account.

## Setting up SAML integration

Go to your SSO settings by clicking on *Account settings* on the left sidebar in the Codefresh UI and then selecting *Single Sign-on* again from the left sibar (or visit directly [https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/sso](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/sso))

Click the *ADD SINGLE SIGN-ON* button and select SAML from the drop-down

Fill in the fields:

* *Client Name* - leave the field empty and it will get an autogenerated value once you save the settings.
* *Display Name* - any arbitrary name you want to give in this integration.
* *IDP entry* - The SSO endpoint of your Identity Provider.
* *Application Certificate* - The security certificate of your Identity Provider. Paste the value directly on the field. Do not convert to base64 or any other encoding by hand. 

Click the *SAVE* button and make sure to note down the `Client Name` that was autogenerated.

Then in the settings of your Identity Provider create a new Service Provider and provide the following:

* *Service Provider SSO endpoint* - `https://g.codefresh.io/api/auth/<your_codefresh_client_name>/callback​` (where ​`<your_codefresh_client_name>​` is taken from the SSO configuration you created on the section above. It was automatically generated by Codefresh after saving the SSO settings.
* *Service Provider Entity ID* -  ​`g.codefresh.io`

The mandatory fields needed for SAML assertions are:

1. firstName - user first name.
1. lastName - user last name.
1. email - user email.

>Notice that these settings are for the SAAS version of Codefresh. For an on-premise Codefresh setup you need to use the URLs that match your installation.

Once everything is finished, you [should test the integration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/sso-setup-oauth2/#testing-your-identity-provider). Once it is working proceed to the next steps that are:

* [Selecting SSO method for collaborators]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/sso-setup-oauth2/#selecting-sso-method-for-collaborators)
* [Syncing of teams after initial SSO setup]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/sso-setup-oauth2/#syncing-of-teams-after-initial-sso-setup)
