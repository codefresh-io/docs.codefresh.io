In this page we will see the process of setting up Google IDP with Codefresh. For the general instructions of SSO setup
see the [overview page]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/sso-setup-oauth2/).


## Create Client Secret

Log in [https://console.developers.google.com/](https://console.developers.google.com/) and select *Credentials* on the left sidebar. Click the *Create Credentials* button and choose *OAuth client ID* from the drop down menu.

In the next screen select *Web application* as the *Application type*. Enter a name for your integration (user-defined). Add as URI `https://g.codefresh.io` in the *Authorized JavaScript origins* section.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/googleSSO.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/googleSSO.png"
alt="Creating an OAuth client"
caption="Creating an OAuth client"
max-width="80%"
%}

Click the *Create* button. You will see a dialog with the client Id and secret values. Note down both of these values.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/googleSSO2.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/googleSSO2.png"
alt="Getting the Client ID and secret"
caption="Getting the Client ID and secret"
max-width="80%"
%}


You will need the Client ID and secret in the Codefresh configuration screen.


## Enter details on the Codefresh side

Go back into Codefresh and choose Google at the [SSO Settings](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/sso)

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/google-idp-integration.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/google-idp-integration.png"
alt="Choosing Google for Auth"
caption="Choosing Google for Auth"
max-width="20%"
%}

In the configuration screen fill in the following:

* `DISPLAY NAME` - Friendly SSO name (arbitrary)
* `CLIENT ID` - Use the value you got from the previous section
* `CLIENT SECRET` - Use the value you got from the previous section


{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/codefresh-settings.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/codefresh-settings.png"
alt="Entering Codefresh Settings"
caption="Entering Codefresh Settings"
max-width="90%"
%}


After clicking SAVE youâ€™ll see the generated Client Name:

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/autogenerated-name.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/autogenerated-name.png"
alt="Getting the auto-generated Client Name"
caption="Getting the auto-generated Client Name"
max-width="90%"
%}

Note this down as you will use it in the Google Console.

## Setup Redirect URI

Go back to the Google Console Developer dashboard and click the edit button on the OAuth 2.0 Client IDs that you created before.

Use the Client Name from the previous section to generate the *Authorized Redirect URIs*

* Example Client Name: `t0nlUJoqQlDv`
* Example Redirect URI: `https://g.codefresh.io/api/auth/t0nlUJoqQlDv/callback`

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/googleSSO3.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/googleSSO3.png"
alt="Redirect URI"
caption="Redirect URI"
max-width="90%"
%}


This concludes the basic SSO setup for Google. For team/group synchronization you also need a service account.

## Synchronize teams with the Codefresh CLI

In the Codefresh configuration screen there are some optional fields that you can fill, in order to 
get team synchronization via the Codefresh CLI. You need to create a service account and [delegate user and group permissions](https://developers.google.com/admin-sdk/directory/v1/guides/delegation) to it.

Create a Service account from Google Console:

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/serviceAccount2.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/serviceAccount2.png"
alt="Creating a service account"
caption="Creating a service account"
max-width="90%"
%}

Delegate from the Google admin console the following permissions:

* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly`
* `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly`

For that service account you should also create a private key in JSON format.


{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/google/serviceAccount3.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/google/serviceAccount3.png"
alt="Creating a JSON key"
caption="Creating a JSON key"
max-width="90%"
%}




Save the file locally. Go back to the Codefresh settings and fill in the fields

* `JSON Keyfile` - enter contents of the JSON file
* `Admin email` -  The user that has access to `admin.google.com`

Now you can [synchronize teams with the Codefresh CLI]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/sso-setup-oauth2/#syncing-of-teams-after-initial-sso-setup) .
