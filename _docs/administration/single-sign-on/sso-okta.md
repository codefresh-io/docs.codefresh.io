In this page we will see the process of setting up Okta SSO with Codefresh. For the general instructions of SSO setup
see the [overview page]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/sso-setup-oauth2/).

## Setting Okta as an Identity provider

1. Log in to your Okta account. If you don't already have one, you will need to create one.

On the general Okta dashboard, click *Admin*. This takes you to the Okta Admin Dashboard.

url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image5.png"
alt="Okta Dashboard"
caption="Okta Dashboard"
max-width="70%"
%}

Using the list of shortcuts at the right-hand side of the screen, click *Add Applications*.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/okta/image8.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image8.png"
alt="Okta Applications"
caption="Okta Applications"
max-width="70%"
%}

On the *Add Application* page, select *Create New App*.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/okta/image9.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image9.png"
alt="Create new application"
caption="Create new application"
max-width="70%"
%}

On the *Create a New Application Integration* pop-up window, select Web as the Platform for Codefresh application, and choose OpenID Connect as the *Sign on method*. Click Create to proceed.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/okta/image1.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image1.png"
alt="Choose Sign-on method"
caption="Choose Sign-on method"
max-width="70%"
%}

{:start="2"}
1. You will now create your OIDC integration. On the *General Settings* page, provide the following:

* App name (e.g. Codefresh)
* App logo (optional). Feel free to download and add this [picture]({{site.baseurl}}/images/administration/sso/okta/codefresh-logo.png)
* Login redirect URI: `https://g.codefresh.io/api/auth/<your_codefresh_client_name>/callback` you’ll be able to extract your Codefresh client name a bit later in the process so we’ll need to come back to this and update it again - for now please use a temp value such as `https://g.codefresh.io/api/auth/temp/callback`

%}

Click *Save* to proceed.

{:start="3"}
1. Go back to the SSO settings screen described in the first part of this guide inside the Codefresh GUI.

You need to enter the following:

* *Display Name* - shown as application name in OKTA.
* *client id* - your OKTA application client ID (see below).
* client secret* - your OKTA application client secret (see below).
* Client Host - your OKTA organization url (e.g `https://<company>.okta.com`). Keep in mind you don’t copy it from the admin view (e.g. `https://<company>-admin.okta.com`) because it’ll not work.
* *Access Token* (optional) - OKTA API token that will be used to sync groups and users from OKTA to Codefresh. The token can be generated in OKTA by going to the security tab->API (see below).
* *App ID* - your Codefresh application ID in your OKTA organization that will be used to sync groups and users from OKTA to Codefresh. This ID can be taken by navigating to your Codefresh APP in OKTA and copy it from the URL (see below).

lightbox="true"

alt="Client ID and secret"
caption="Client ID and secret"
max-width="70%"
%}

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/okta/image2.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image2.png"
alt="Access token"
caption="Access token"
max-width="70%"
%}

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/okta/image3.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image3.png"
alt="App ID"
caption="App ID"
max-width="70%"
%}

{:start="4"}
1. Once you save the Identity provider, Codefresh will assign a client-name to it which identifies the SSO configuration.
Note it down.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/administration/sso/okta/image6.png" 
url="/images/administration/sso/okta/image6.png"
alt="Client name"
caption="Client name"
max-width="50%"
%}

{:start="5"}
1. Go Back to your OKTA Application General Settings and update the following 2 configurations with the client name generated by Codefresh:

* Login redirect URIs - `https://g.codefresh.io/api/auth/<your_codefresh_client_name>/callback`
* Initiate login URI - `https://g.codefresh.io/api/auth/<your_codefresh_client_name>`

This concludes the SSO setup for Okta.
