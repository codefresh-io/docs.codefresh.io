If you want to use Codefresh for [a Kubernetes cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy-to-kubernetes/add-kubernetes-cluster/) that has a strict firewall, you can only allow access to specific IP addresses
that the Codefresh platform is using. This will allow you to deploy to your cluster even when it is not accessible from the public internet

>Note that this is needed only for customers that use the [SAAS version of Codefresh]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/installation-security/). If you use the [Codefresh runner]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/codefresh-runner/), there is no need to open any IPs and ports in your firewall.

## Current IPs used by the Codefresh platform

- 104.154.63.253    
- 104.197.160.122    
- 18.213.176.41    
- 13.59.201.170    
- 104.155.130.126    
- 147.234.23.250    
- 34.233.31.180
- 18.210.174.176   
- 104.154.99.188     
- 146.148.100.14    
- 34.237.229.16


All the IPs are NAT gateways, and therefore you only need to enable specific IPs instead of ranges.

>If you do use these IPs we **strongly encourage** regular monitoring of this doc page.
