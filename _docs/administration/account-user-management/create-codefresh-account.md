Creating an account in Codefresh is the first step to begin working with the Codefresh platform.

<!--- Creating an account provides access to the Codefresh platform, where you can install Runtimes, and create and manage GitOps entities.
After you select the IdP (identity provider), Codefresh requests permission to access your basic details, and for Git providers, to access your Git repositories. 

The permissions requested by Codefresh are needed in order to build and deploy your projects. -->

## Supported IdPs
Codefresh currently supports the following IdPs:
* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* GitLab 
* Azure
* Google 
* LDAP

If you need an IdP that is not in the list, please [contact us](https://codefresh.io/contact-us/){:target="\_blank"} with the details.


>**NOTE**     
For Git repositories, the login method is less important, as you can access Git repositories through Git integrations, regardless of your sign-up process. <br><br>
If you have multiple sign-up methods, as long as you use the same email address in all the sign-ups, Codefresh automatically redirects you to the account dashboard.
