Control access to entities in GitOps through ABAC (Attribute-Based Access Control). ABAC allows fine-grained access to application entities through the use of rules.  
Define ABAC for applications, products, and promotion entities, in the Codefresh UI or programmatically via Terraform.<br>
For more information on ABAC, see [ABAC on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attribute-based_access_control){:target="\_blank"}. 


Rules define the *who*, *what*, and *where* to control access through the following elements:
* **Entities**  
  The entity for which to create the rule.  
    * [Applications](#applications-actions--attributes)
    * [Environments](#environments-actions--attributes)
    * [Products](#products-actions--attributes)

* **Teams**  
  Teams control the _who_ part of the rule. See [Adding users and teams]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/add-users/). 

* **Actions**  
  Actions control the _what_ part of the rule. You need to select at least one action per entity. Available actions differ based on the selected entity.

* **Attributes**  
  Attributes control the _where_ part of the rule. They include standard Kubernetes (clusters, namespaces, and labels), and Codefresh-specific attributes(Runtimes and Git Sources). The attributes which are available depend on the selected entity.<br>
  Adding attributes, either individually or in combination, allow more fine-grained access control to enforce the _where_ policies for teams and actions. <br>Single attributes are useful to grant or deny access based on a specific property. Combinations of attributes help enforce more complex access control. 


## Create an access rule for GitOps entities via Codefresh UI
For each rule, you must select or define the:
* Entity for which to create the rule
* Team or teams the rule applies to, with at least one team being mandatory 
* Action or actions permitted for the entity, with at least one action being mandatory
* Attribute or attributes determining where access is permitted

<br>

##### Before you begin
* Review:
  * [Applications](#applications-actions--attributes)
  * [Environments](#environments-actions--attributes)
  * [Products](#products-actions--attributes)


##### How to

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon.
1. On the sidebar, from Access & Collaboration, select [**GitOps Permissions**](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/permissions/teams){:target="\_blank"}.
1. To create a rule, click **Add** and define the following:
  *  **Entity**: One of the following: {::nomarkdown} <ul><li>GitOps Applications</li><li>Promotion Flows</li><li>Products</li><li>Environments</li></ul>{:/}
  * **Team**: The team or teams to which to give access to the selected entity. 
  * **Actions**: The actions to permit based on those available for the selected entity.
  * **Attributes**: One more attributes based on those available for the selected entity.
1. To confirm, click **Add** once again. 

  {% include

   alt="Add rule for application entities" 
   caption="Add rule for application entities"
   max-width="50%" 
  %}

The rule you added for the entity is displayed in the GitOps Permissions page. Edit or delete the rule by clicking the respective icons.

## Create an access rule for GitOps entities programmatically via Terraform
You can also create rules enforcing ABAC for GitOps via Terraform. 
See the documentation for [codefresh_abac_rules](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/codefresh-io/codefresh/latest/docs/resources/abac_rules){:target="\_blank"}.
