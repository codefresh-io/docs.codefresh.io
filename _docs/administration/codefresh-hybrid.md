Codefresh lets you use your own host as a build agent to run/build containers. In order to do this, you have to first install the Codefresh Agent on your machine.

The following Linux distributions are supported:

- Ubuntu 14.04, 15.04, 16.04
- Debian 8
- Centos 7+
- RedHat Linux 7
- Fedora 21, 22

In order for Codefresh to communicate with the Docker daemon running on your node, port `tcp:2376` should be open on your node's firewall.
