Codefresh offers native support for integrating with Quay, enabling seamless pushing, pulling, and deploying of container images.

By adding a Quay integration in Codefresh, you can reference the integration account in external CI tools, such as GitHub Actions, using the integration name instead of managing explicit credentials. This simplifies security and enhances the ease of managing integrations in GitOps.

For general information on container registry integrations for GitOps, see [Container registry GitOps integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/container-registries/).

## Prerequisites

1. [Create a Redhat/Quay account at Quay](https://quay.io/){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Optional. For Codefresh integration, [create a robot account](https://docs.quay.io/glossary/robot-accounts.html){:target="\_blank"}.
