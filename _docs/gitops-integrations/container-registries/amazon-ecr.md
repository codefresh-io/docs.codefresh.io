Codefresh has native support for interacting with Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry), to push, pull, and deploy images.  
For information on adding an Amazon ECR integration for GitOps in Codefresh, see [Container registry GitOps integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/container-registries/).

>Amazon ECR integration is supported only for Hybrid GitOps.

## Prerequisites
Before you configure settings in Codefresh to integrate Amazon ECR:  
* [Create an IAM (Identity and Access Management) role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html){:target="\_blank"}  

Define the role in trusted relationships with `Effect: Allow` and  `Action: sts:AssumeRole` on the EKS cluster.  
For example:  
```yaml
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
    "Principal": {
        "AWS": "arn:aws:iam::XXXXX:role/eksctl-awscluster-ServiceRole-XXXXXX"
            },
        "Action": "sts:AssumeRole",
        "Condition": {}
}
```
For detailed information, see [How Amazon Elastic Container Registry Works with IAM](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security_iam_service-with-iam.html){:target="\_blank"} and the [AWS security blog](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/security/how-to-use-trust-policies-with-iam-roles/){:target="\_blank"}.

## Amazon ECR-GitOps integration settings in Codefresh
The table describes the arguments required for GitOps integrations with Amazon ECR in Codefresh.

The exact location depends on whether the integration is shared with all or specific runtimes: <br><ul><li>All runtimes: Created in <span style="font-family: var(--font-family-monospace); font-size: 87.5%; color: #ad6800; background-color: #fffbe6">resources/all-runtimes-all-clusters/</span></li><li>Selected runtimes: Created in <span style="font-family: var(--font-family-monospace); font-size: 87.5%; color: #ad6800; background-color: #fffbe6">resources/runtimes/<runtime-name>/</span></li></ul> You can reference the Docker Hub integration in the CI tool. {:/}|
