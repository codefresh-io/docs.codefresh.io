The GitHub Container registry allows you to host and manage your Docker container images in your personal or organisation account on GitHub. One of the benefits is that permissions can be defined for the Docker image independent from any repository. Thus, your repository could be private and your Docker image public.   
For information on adding a GitHub Container registry integration in Codefresh, see [Container registry GitOps integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/container-registries/).

## Prerequisites
Before you configure settings in Codefresh to integrate GitHub container registry:  
* Make sure you have a personal access token with the correct scopes or create one.  
  You need at least the following scopes:  
  * `write:packages`  
  * `read:packages`
  * `delete:packages`
  * `repo` (if your repository is private; do not select if it is public)  

  For detailed information, see the [Authenticating to the Container registry](https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-container-registry#authenticating-to-the-container-registry){:target="\_blank"}.
