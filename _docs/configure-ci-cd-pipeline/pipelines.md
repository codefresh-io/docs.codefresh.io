Before reading this page make sure that you are familiar with the [theory behind Codefresh pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/).

## Pipeline Concepts

The aim of Codefresh pipelines is to have re-usable sequences of steps that can be used for different applications (or micro-services) via the use of git triggers.

All the main concepts are shown below:

* **Projects** are the top-level concept in Codefresh. You can create projects to group pipelines that are related. In most cases a single project will be a single application (that itself contains many micro-services). You are free to use projects as you see fit. For example, you could create a project for a specific Kubernetes cluster or a specific team/department.

* Each project can have multiple **pipelines**. Pipelines that belong to a single project are easily managed all together. It is also very easy to create a new pipeline in a project by copying an existing pipeline. Notice that unlike other CI solutions a pipeline in Codefresh is **NOT** tied to a specific git repository. You should try to make your pipelines generic enough so that they can be reused for similar applications even when they exist in different git repositories (a fairly typical setup for microservices).

* Each pipeline has a definition that defines the [pipeline steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/) that are executed each time this pipeline is triggered. The definition of a pipeline is described in a special [codefresh.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) file. The `codefresh.yml` file can be fetched from the same repository of the source code, from a completely different repository or even defined in-place in the Codefresh pipeline editor. Again, notice that it is possible to have a pipeline that checks out its source code from git repository A, but actually defines its steps in a `codefresh.yml` file that is fetched from git repository B.

* Each pipeline can have zero, one or more [triggers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/triggers/). Codefresh supports several kinds of triggers such as Git, Cron or Docker push triggers. Triggers that happen with Git webhooks can come from the same git repository that contains the git code **OR** any other completely different repository. Triggers are the linking medium between a pipeline and a git repository. You can have a pipeline with many triggers so it will be executed when a code happens to any of them.

With these basic building blocks, you can define many complex workflows. In particular, it is very easy in Codefresh to create a scenario where

1. A pipeline is launched because a trigger exists for Git repository A
1. The pipeline reads its `codefresh.yml` file from Git repository B
1. The pipeline clones source code from Git repository C (and starts packaging/compiling it).

Of course, it also possible to have a simpler scenario where the trigger, the pipeline steps and the source code of the application are all defined for the same GIT repository.


## Creating new pipelines

You can create new projects by clicking on *Projects* in the left sidebar and then selecting the *New Project* button on the top right corner. A dialog will appear that will ask you for the project name and optional tags that you can use for [access control]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/enterprise/access-control/).

Once you are inside the project view you can start editing pipelines with a UI environment that works similar to a traditional IDE.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/create/pipeline-manager.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/create/pipeline-manager.png"
alt="Pipeline manager" 
caption="Pipeline manager"
max-width="70%"
%}

1. On the top left you can see your current project. You can also change it by clicking on the drop-down on the top left corner.

1. On the left side of the screen you can see all pipelines that currently belong to this project. Click on each one to edit it.
On the bottom part of this panel the *New pipeline* button allows you to create a new pipeline on the same project either from scratch
or by copying an existing one from the same project or a completely different project.

1. The name of the currently edited pipeline is shown at the top of the window

1. The main window shows the definition of the current pipeline. The screenshot shows the inline editor but pipelines can also be defined from external files (checked into source control) as explained later.

1. The right part of the window shows extra settings for this pipeline such as [premade steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/), [triggers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/triggers/) and launch variables/parameters.




### Using the inline pipeline editor

When first creating a pipeline you will see an inline editor that allows you to define the [pipeline yml]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) right there in the Codefresh UI. This is great when you are starting a new project because it offers you really quick feedback. You can edit the yml steps, run a build, edit again, run a build and so on. 


{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/create/inline-editor.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/create/inline-editor.png"
alt="Inline Pipeline editor" 
caption="Inline Pipeline editor"
max-width="60%"
%}

On the top right of the panel you have additional controls

* The *import* button allows you to bring a `codefresh.yml` from your local workstation into the editor
* The *comment* button allows you to quickly comment/uncomment the currently selected text. The hotkey `Ctrl-/` also performs the same action
* The *formatting* button enriches the editor with special symbols for line breaks, spaces and tabs. This allows you to easily fix common formatting errors
* The *copy* button quickly copies the **whole** pipeline text in your clipboard.


Notice that in the editor you can expand/collapse individual yaml blocks using the arrow triangles on the left of each blocks. The initial pipeline presented in the editor is suggested by Codefresh according to the contents of your Git repository.

> You can also see the suggested Codefresh pipeline for any public git repository by using the [analyze option](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/analyzer/) of the Codefresh CLI.


## Loading codefresh.yml from version control

Working with the inline editor is very convenient in the beginning, but it makes your pipeline definition only exist within the Codefresh UI and therefore goes against the basic principles of [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code). Once you are happy with how your pipeline works you should commit it to a Git repository (which can be the same one that has the source code of the application or a completely different one).

You can click on the *Inline YAML* header and switch it to *Use YAML from repository*.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/create/pipeline-from-internal-repo.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/create/pipeline-from-internal-repo.png"
alt="Pipeline from internal repo" 
caption="Pipeline from internal repo"
max-width="60%"
%}

You can then select **any** Git repository accessible to you and load the `codefresh.yml` from there. You also setup two additional settings:

* The path of the file inside the repository. This allows you to have special folders for pipeline definitions
* The branch of the repository to use for loading the `codefresh.yml` file if you have more than one.

In the branch drop down you can also choose the option **DYNAMIC**. This will use the same branch as the one mentioned in the trigger event. If for example your pipeline is triggered by a commit in the `staging` branch of the source code, the pipeline definition will also be loaded from the `staging` branch of the git repository that contains the `codefresh.yml` file.

This allows you to have complex pipeline definitions per branch, but you have to be careful to match Git branch names between the repository that holds the source code and the repository that holds the pipeline definition. It is much easier to pick a specific branch for the pipeline definitions that will always be the same.

It is also possible to switch the header to *Use YAML from URL*. This will allow you to load a Codefresh yaml from any public URL. Notice that a raw URL is needed in the case of GitHub. As an example, instead of using `https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/example-voting-app/blob/master/codefresh.yml` you should enter `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/codefresh-contrib/example-voting-app/master/codefresh.yml`

## Pipeline settings

Once you create your pipeline you can also click on the top tab called *Settings* for some extra parameters.

Here you can also see the name and ID of the pipeline (useful information if you want to work with the [Codefresh CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/)).

The other options are

* A freetext pipeline description
* One or more tags used for [access control]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/)
* Concurrency limits
* The [runtime environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/enterprise/behind-the-firewall/) that will run this pipeline
* The size of the machine that will run this pipeline (available options depend on your pricing plan)
* The [public logs and badges]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/build-status/) information which are very useful for open source projects developed with Codefresh

The concurrency limits are very important as they allow you to define how many instances of a pipeline can run in parallel when multiple commits or multiple pull requests take place.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/create/restrict-parallelism.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/create/restrict-parallelism.png"
alt="Setting concurrency limits" 
caption="Setting concurrency limits"
max-width="50%"
%}

Some common scenarios are 

* a pipeline that uses a shared resource such as a database or queue and you want to limit how many pipelines can access it
* a pipeline that deploys to a single production environment (in most cases you only want one active pipeline touching production)

You can set these parameters either on the trigger level or on the pipeline level (if the pipeline has multiple triggers defined).

## Pipelines that do not belong to any project

Although we recommend adding all your pipelines to a project, this is not a hard requirement. You can create pipelines that do not belong to a project from the *Pipelines* section on the left sidebar.
If you have a Codefresh account created before May 2019 you might already have several pipelines that are like this.

If you change your mind, you can also add detached pipelines (i.e. pipelines that are not part of a project) manually from the 3-dot menu that is found on the right of each pipeline. 

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/create/add-pipeline-to-project.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/create/add-pipeline-to-project.png"
alt="Changing the project of a pipeline" 
caption="Changing the project of a pipeline"
max-width="90%"
%}

Pipelines that belong to a project will mention it bellow their name so it is very easy to understand which pipelines belong to a project and which do not.
