Configure Docker Hub as a Docker registry for CI pipelines to push images to it.

1.Select [**Docker Hub** as the registry provider]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/#general-configuration).
1. Define the following:  
  * Registry Name: A unique name for this configuration.
  * Username: Docker Hub username.
  * Password: Docker Hub [personal account token](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/){:target="\_blank"}, or Dockerhub account password (not recommended).
    >If you have enabled [two-factor-authentication in Docker Hub](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/2fa/){:target="\_blank"}, then in the Password field, paste a Docker personal access token (instead of your Docker Hub master password). Otherwise, Codefresh will not be able to push your image.  
      If you don't have 2FA enabled in Dockerhub, then you can also use your Dockerhub account password. But in all cases we suggest you create a personal access token for Codefresh (personal access tokens are more secure as you can revoke them on demand and see when they were last used).

	caption="Add Docker Hub registry" 
	max-width="50%" 
%}


>Docker.io only allows you to push images that are tagged with your username. If you have a choice, create
a Docker Hub account with the same username that you have in Codefresh. If not, you need to change the Docker image
created to match your username in every [push step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/push/#examples).


## Adding more Docker Hub integrations

You can add additional Docker Hub accounts using the same process. 


{% include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/integrations/docker-registries/dockerhub/two-dockerhub-integrations.png" 
	url="/images/integrations/docker-registries/dockerhub/two-dockerhub-integrations.png" 
	alt="Additional Docker Hub integrations" 
	caption="Additional Docker Hub integrations" 
	max-width="80%" 
%}


You can specify which registry will be used as primary/default for the `docker.io` domain.
Use the appropriate `registry name` value in your pipelines in order to decide which Dockerhub account will be used.

Here is a pipeline that pushes to two different Docker Hub accounts:

{% include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/integrations/docker-registries/dockerhub/pushing-two-dockerhub-accounts.png" 
	url="/images/integrations/docker-registries/dockerhub/pushing-two-dockerhub-accounts.png" 
	alt="Pushing to multiple Dockerhub accounts" 
	caption="Pushing to multiple Dockerhub accounts" 
	max-width="90%" 
%}

This is the [definition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) for the pipeline:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
stages:
  - "clone"
  - "build"
  - "push"

steps:
  clone:
    title: "Cloning repository"
    type: "git-clone"
    repo: "kostis-codefresh/trivial-go-web"
    revision: "master"
    stage: "clone"
  build:
    title: "Building Docker image"
    type: "build"
    image_name: "trivial-go-web"
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    tag: "latest"
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile.multistage"
    stage: "build"
    disable_push: true
  push1:
    title: "Pushing 1st Docker image"
    type: push
    image_name: "kostiscodefresh/trivial-go-web"
    tag: "latest"
    stage: "push" 
    registry: dockerhub
    candidate: ${{build}}
  push2:
     title: "Pushing 2nd Docker image"
     type: push
     image_name: "kkapelon/trivial-go-web"
     tag: "latest"
     stage: "push" 
     registry: second-dockerhub
     candidate: ${{build}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The two Dockerhub accounts are `kkapelon` and `kostiscodefresh`, and Codefresh automatically uses the correct integration by looking at the `image_name` property of the push step.
