You can integrate Slack globally, or for specific pipelines and builds. Codefresh can post notifications to Slack, for example, for successful and failed builds, and direct messages received within the Codefresh app.
To integrate through a custom webhook, see the [Slack documentation](https://api.slack.com/messaging/webhooks){:target="\_blank"}.  
You can also look at our example on [how to set up a custom webhook notification to Slack]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/example-catalog/ci-examples/sending-the-notification-to-slack/#custom-webhook-to-slack).


## Notification options for Slack 

Enable notifications for builds based on their status:  
* Successful
* Failed
* Pending manual approval to continue
* Terminated by system  
  When selected, you receive notifications based on the build termination policies configured for the pipeline. These can be whenever:   
    * Previous builds from the same or a specific branch are terminated once a build is created for that branch
    * Running builds are terminated once a build is created
    * Child builds are terminated when the parent build is terminated

    Here's an example of the notification in Slack for a system-terminated build:
    
    {% include image.html 
    lightbox="true" 
    file="/images/integrations/slack/system-terminate-build-slack-example.png" 
    url="/images/integrations/slack/system-terminate-build-slack-example.png" 
    caption="Example of Slack notification for system-terminated build"
    alt="Example of Slack notification for system-terminated build" 
    max-width="60%" 
%}

alt="Add Slack integration" 
max-width="50%"

## How Slack notifications work

When you have Slack integration enabled:

1. All pipelines launched automatically by [triggers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/triggers/), send Slack notifications
1. All pipelines executed manually, do **NOT** send Slack notifications.
  You can override the default behavior for notifications through the **Report notification on pipeline execution** option for pipelines. This is available under **Advanced Settings** for Git and Cron triggers, or the Run settings of a pipeline.
  When selected, sends email notifications for pipelines which are executed manually.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/integrations/slack/report-notifications.png" 
url="/images/integrations/slack/report-notifications.png" 
alt="Select to send notifications for manually executed builds" 
caption="Select to send notifications for manually executed builds" 
max-width="40%" 
%}

## Individual pipeline Slack integration

If you wish for more fine-grained control over Slack notifications, then take a look at any of the available slack plugins:
