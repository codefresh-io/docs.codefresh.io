You can integrate Slack globally, or for specific pipelines and builds.

## Set up global Slack integration in Codefresh
<!--- what about webhooks?  -->
1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, and then from the sidebar, select [**Pipeline Integrations**](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/account-conf/integration){:target="\_blank"}. 
1. Select **Slack** and then click **Configure**.
1. Select **Quick Setup**.
1. Select the types of notifications you want to receive on Slack.
1. Click **Add to Slack**.<br> You are redirected to the Slack sign-in page.
1. Log in with your Slack credentials.
1. Select the check box to enable notifications for Slack.
1. Click **Save**.

Codefresh can now post notifications to Slack, for example, notifications of successful and failed builds, and direct messages received within the Codefresh app.

## How Slack notifications work

When you have Slack integration enabled:

1. All pipelines that are launched automatically by [triggers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/triggers/) send Slack notifications
1. All pipelines that are executed manually do **NOT** send Slack notifications.

You can override this behavior by toggling the checkbox **Report notification on pipeline execution** under **Advanced Settings**
either in a Git trigger dialog or the Run settings of a pipeline.
