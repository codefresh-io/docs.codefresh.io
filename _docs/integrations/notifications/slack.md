You can integrate Slack globally or on specific pipelines and builds.

## Global Slack integration

To integrate Codefresh with Slack
first go to your Account Configuration, by clicking on *Account Settings* on the left sidebar. 

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/integrations/codefresh-integrations.png" 
url="/images/integrations/codefresh-integrations.png" 
alt="Codefresh integrations.png" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

Then:


1. Click on *configure* in the Slack section.
1. Select the Slack check box.
1. Click the **`Add to Slack`** button.<br> You are redirected to the Slack sign-in page.
1. Log in with your Slack credentials.
1. Select the check box to enable notifications for Slack.
1. Click **`Save`**.



Codefresh can now post notifications to Slack, for example, notifications of successful and failed builds, and direct messages received within the Codefresh app.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/integrations/slack/add-slack-integration.png" 
url="/images/integrations/slack/add-slack-integration.png" 
alt="Add Slack integration" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

You can also select the checkboxes on the right for the type of messages you want to have.
