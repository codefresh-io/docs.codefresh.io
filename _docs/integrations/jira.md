Codefresh integrates with Jira in several ways. This article describes how to integrate with Jira in Codefresh for the highest visibility into your GitOps deployments.  
Alternatively, you can connect to Jira:
* Through a [custom step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/notifications/jira-integration/#use-jira-within-your-codefresh-pipeline) from our step marketplace so that you can connect your pipelines with Jira
* By using your own [jira-cli]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/notifications/jira-integration/#using-your-own-jira-cli)

## Prerequisites
* [Codefresh account]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/create-a-codefresh-account/)
* [Jira Account](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira){:target="\_blank"}

## Set up Jira integration in Codefresh
<!---The goal of the Codefresh [GitOps Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ci-cd-guides/gitops-deployments/) is to provide the highest observability into your deployments. The Codefresh GitOps Dashboard tags the Jira issues associated to deployments automatically through the Codefresh Jira Integration. This section will provide an overview of setting up the integration. -->

When you add a new Jira integration in Codefresh, you can authenticate either using the:  
* [Codefresh Marketplace App]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/notifications/jira-integration/#authenticate-with-the-jira-client-key)  
  We recommended setting up your Jira integration through our Marketplace App.  
  > Note that Codefresh currently has to provide you with access to use the Jira Marketplace App. Please get in touch for more information.
 
* [Jira Account Details]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/notifications/jira-integration/#provide-account-details)

<br />

**Before you begin**  

* To authenticate through the Marketplace App:
  * Get the [Organization URL and the Client Key for the Codfresh App from Jira](#jira-integration-with-marketplace-app)

**How to**  

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, and then from the sidebar, select [**Pipeline Integrations**](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/account-conf/integration){:target="\_blank"}. 
1. Select **Atlassian Jira** and then click **Configure**.
1. Click **Add Jira**.
1. In the **Integration Name** field, enter a name for the integration which is used to reference it in `codefresh.yaml`.
1. To restrict access to only Codefresh admins, toggle **Allow access to all users** to OFF.
  <!--- >>When access is restricted, users **cannot** use the [CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/){:target="\_blank"} or [API]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/codefresh-api/) to [programmatically access this Helm repository](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/contexts/){:target="\_blank"}.  
   Otherwise, all users from all your Codefresh teams will be able to access this Helm repository with CLI commands or API calls.  -->
1. To integrate with the Codefresh Marketplace App, click **Jira Marketplace App**:
   * Paste the **Organization URL** and the **Client Key** you generated for the Codefresh App in Jira. 
1. To integrate with your Jira account details, select **User/Pass**, and define the following:
  * **Jira URL**: The URL of your organization, for example, `https://company-name.atlassian.netâ€™.

  * **Password**: Your Jira password, or alternatively, the Jira Client Key.

## Jira integration with Marketplace App
You need to generate the Organization URL and Client Key for the Codefresh application in Atlassian Jira.


1. In the Atlassian Marketplace, go to the [Codefresh Application](https://marketplace.atlassian.com/apps/1224560/codefresh){:target="\_blank"}.
    {% include image.html 
    lightbox="true" 
    file="/images/integrations/jira/add-app.png" 
    url="/images/integrations/jira/add-app.png" 
    alt="Add Codefresh from Jira App Marketplace" 
    caption="Add Codefresh from Jira App Marketplace" 
    max-width="90%" 
    %}

{:start="2"}    
1. To install the application, click **Get it now**. When prompted, confirm the installation.
    {% include image.html 
    lightbox="true" 
    file="/images/integrations/jira/confirm.png" 
    url="/images/integrations/jira/confirm.png" 
    alt="Confirm installation" 
    caption="Confirm installation" 
    max-width="90%" 
    %}

{:start="3"}     
1. When the installation has completed, in your Jira account, go to the **Apps** menu.
1. Click **Manage your apps**.

    {% include image.html 
    lightbox="true" 
    file="/images/integrations/jira/manage-apps.png" 
    url="/images/integrations/jira/manage-apps.png" 
    alt="Select Manage Apps within Your Jira Account" 
    caption="Select Manage Apps within Your Jira Account" 
    max-width="90%" 
    %}

{:start="5"}  
1. In **User-installed apps**, locate the Codefresh CI/CD platform integration.
1. Click **Configure**.
  This will provide you with your Organization URL and the Client Key. 

    {% include image.html 
    lightbox="true" 
    file="/images/integrations/jira/configure.png" 
    url="/images/integrations/jira/configure.png" 
    alt="Account information" 
    caption="Account information" 
    max-width="90%" 
    %}

  
{:start="7"} 
1. Copy **Organization URL** and the **Client Key**. You will need these to set up Jira integration with the Codefresh Marketplace App. 




## Using the Jira Integration

Once Jira is connected to your Codefresh account, you can use both platforms in combination and integrate Jira into your [GitOps workflow]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ci-cd-guides/gitops-deployments/).
