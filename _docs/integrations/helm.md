Codefresh is one of the few DevOps platforms with native support for Helm releases and deployments.
In addition to the [built-in Helm repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/managed-helm-repository/) available to all Codefresh accounts,you can add any external Helm repository to Codefresh through integrations.

Native support for Helm in Codefresh includes:  
 * A pipeline [step for deploying Helm applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/)
 * A dashboard for your [Helm charts]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-charts-and-repositories/)
 * A dashboard for your [Helm releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-releases-management/)
 * A dashboard for [promoting Helm releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-environment-promotion/) between different environments
 * A dashboard for [Helm environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/kubernetes/environment-dashboard/)

The built-in Helm repository is production ready. You can start using Helm right away with your Codefresh account,
even if you don't have an external Helm repository. See our [quick start guide for Helm]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/ci-quick-start/deploy-with-helm/)  or the [complete Helm example]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/example-catalog/cd-examples/helm/).  

For each Helm integration, you can toggle the level of access for [non-admin users]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/#users-and-administrators). 

>**IMPORTANT**:  
The name assigned to the integration must be unique within the account. Using the same name for other integrations or Shared Configuration contexts within pipelines will result in conflicts.<br>For troubleshooting, see [Error: context already exists]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/kb/articles/error-context-already-exists/).

## Set up external Helm integration

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, and then from the sidebar, select [**Pipeline Integrations**](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/account-conf/integration){:target="\_blank"}. 
1. Select **Helm** and then click **Configure**.
1. From the **Add Helm Repository** dropdown, select the type of external Helm repository:
  * [Azure Registry](#azure-registry-helm-repository-settings)
  * [Azure Regsitry MI](#azure-registry-with-managed-identity-mi-helm-repository-settings)
  * [Azure Registry SP](#azure-registry-with-service-principal-sp-helm-repository-settings)
  * [Codefresh](#helm-repository-from-another-codefresh-account)
  * [Google Cloud Storage](#google-cloud-storage-gcs-helm-repository-settings)
  * [HTTP Basic Authentication](#http-basic-authentication-settings)
  * [Amazon AWS S3](#amazon-aws-s3-helm-repository-settings)


1. To restrict access to only Codefresh admins, toggle **Allow access to all users** to OFF.
  >When access is restricted, users **cannot** use the [CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/){:target="\_blank"} or [API]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/codefresh-api/) to [programmatically access this Helm repository](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/contexts/){:target="\_blank"}.  
   Otherwise, all users from all your Codefresh teams will be able to access this Helm repository with CLI commands or API calls.

### Azure Registry Helm repository settings

### Helm repository from another Codefresh account

You also add the private Helm repository of another Codefresh user as your integration.

>We **don't** recommend sharing the Codefresh Helm repository between accounts. The built-in Helm repository of each account is best used as a private Helm repository of that account. See more details on [how to make your private Helm public]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/managed-helm-repository/#repo-access-level).

The table below describes the settings. 

Setting|Description
---|---
**Helm Repository Name**|The unique name for the Helm repository integration which is used to reference the integration in `codefresh.yaml`
**Helm Repository URL**|The URL to the Helm repository in the format `cm://repository-name`.
**CF API Key**|A token [to access the other Codefresh account]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/codefresh-api/#authentication-instructions).

### Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Helm repository settings 

You can connect to a Google Cloud Storage (GCS) Helm repository. Supply the GCS authentication credentials as you would for the GCloud CLI, or the GCS plugin for Helm.
