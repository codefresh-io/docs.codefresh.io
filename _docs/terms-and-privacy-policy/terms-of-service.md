## Customer Agreement FAQs

##### I want to talk pricing!
Take a look at our [Licensing & Purchasing FAQ](https://octopus.com/pricing/faq){:target="\_blank"}!

##### We can’t accept your agreement. Can you use ours?
We understand that some customers have their own preferred set of agreements, and we appreciate that you’ve taken the time to consider how we work together. However, to ensure a consistent and smooth experience for all of our customers, we do need to rely on our standard Customer Agreement documents.

Our standard documents are specifically tailored to our products and services. They reflect the legal, operational, and security frameworks that we’ve put in place to protect both our company and our customers. This helps us maintain a uniform approach that is crucial for delivering the high-quality service you expect.

Using our agreement also allows us to be efficient in managing our relationships, ensuring that all of our customers are treated fairly and consistently. While we understand that every business is unique, we have carefully crafted our agreement to cover the essential aspects of our collaboration, and we believe it will meet your needs.

If you have any specific concerns or questions about the terms, we’re more than happy to discuss them with you and see how we can address them within our agreement. Thank you for your understanding and for helping us maintain a seamless process.


###### We still need to make some changes. Can’t you make an exception for us? 

We understand that sometimes it’s not your choice. For example, you may be operating in a highly regulated industry, and we appreciate there are sometimes prudential or regulatory requirements that you may need to comply with. 

If there’s no other way forward, we’re open to discussing these requests, but there are some important things to keep in mind.
When evaluating requests for amendments or the use of a customer’s own template agreement, we assess several factors that we’ve developed internally. These factors help us manage the additional complexity that comes with customized agreements, although they may be subject to change as our business evolves. For instance:

* customers wishing to negotiate should be on Enterprise licensing. 
* to consider amending our standard terms, we look for a minimum commitment of at least:
    * $250,000 per year; or
    * $150,000 per year over a minimum three-year term.
* to consider using a custom agreement, we look for a minimum commitment of at least:
    * $400,000 per year; or
    * $250,000 per year over a minimum three-year term. 

It’s also important to note that while we are open to negotiation, this doesn’t necessarily mean that we will accept your request, or be able to accommodate all requested changes or adopt your proposed agreement without adjustments. There are certain aspects of our terms that we simply aren’t able to deviate from. For example, if you require priority support, this must align with our Priority Support Terms. Similarly, our Data Processing Agreement reflects the intricacies of our data handling and business operations, which are standardized across our business and our customer base to ensure compliance and efficiency. We don’t have scope to make major changes to these, regardless of the opportunity. 

Additionally, third-party template agreements often include terms that aren’t applicable to our software and services. These might create inconsistencies or even conflicts with the way we operate, which is why we prefer to use our own agreements whenever possible.

We’re here to work with you to find a solution that meets your needs while also protecting both parties and ensuring a smooth working relationship. Please feel free to reach out to [sales@octopus.com](mailto:sales@octopus.com)<!---  TBD--> if you have any specific questions or concerns, and we’ll do our best to address them.


##### Can you please accept our vendor supply chain policy / code of conduct / etc.?

We completely agree with the importance of maintaining robust security, adhering to ethical business practices, and operating in a socially and environmentally responsible manner. We understand your concerns regarding issues like child labor, modern slavery, and other unacceptable practices. It’s vital for you to have confidence that we conduct our business with integrity and care.

However, in addition to providing standard (not bespoke) software and services, we’re also an Australian company with a global presence, and specific customer policies often don’t reflect the complexity of our global environment, such as what laws apply. This consistency is crucial for ensuring that our software and services remain secure, efficient, and reliable for everyone. For this reason, we are unable to accept third-party security, code of conduct, or social responsibility policies without undergoing a formal amendment process. Such amendments would need to meet the same criteria outlined in the section on negotiating agreements, which includes considerations around minimum commitments and other factors.

If you’re interested in reviewing our policies, we’re proud to share that we have received SOC 2 attestation, backed by annual audits conducted by independent third parties, ensuring that our practices meet rigorous standards. If you would like to know more, please contact us.
