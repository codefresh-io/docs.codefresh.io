Subject to the limited licenses expressly granted hereunder, Codefresh and its licensors reserve their respective right, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all of Codefresh’s and its licensors related intellectual property rights related to the Service (the “<b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>”). No rights are granted to Licensee hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein. Codefresh shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to Intellectual Property Rights, including any Software, all improvements, enhancements, modifications, and derivative works thereof, and all related Intellectual Property Rights. </p>

<p><b>12.2.&nbsp; </span></b><b>License to Host Licensee Content</b>. Licensee hereby grants Codefresh a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, limited-term license to host, copy, transmit and display Licensee Content that Licensee or any User posts to the Service, solely as necessary for Codefresh to provide the Service in accordance with these Terms. Subject to the limited licenses granted herein, Codefresh acquires no right, title or interest from Licensee or Licensee’s licensors under these Terms in or to Licensee Content.</p>

<h5>13. CONFIDENTIALITY</a><span style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h5>

<p>Any technical, financial, business or other information provided by one party (the “<b>Disclosing Party</b>”) to the other party (the “<b>Receiving Party</b>”) and designated as confidential or proprietary or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure (“<b>Confidential Information</b>”) shall be held in confidence and not disclosed and shall not be used except to the extent necessary to carry out the Receiving Party’s obligations or express rights hereunder, except as otherwise authorized by the
Disclosing Party in writing. For clarity, the Service and Codefresh Content shall be deemed Confidential Information of Codefresh whether or not otherwise designated as such. The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than a reasonable standard of care). These obligations
will not apply to information that (i) was previously known by the Receiving Party, as demonstrated by documents or files in existence at the time of disclosure, (ii) is generally and freely publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party, (iii) the Receiving Party otherwise rightfully obtains from third parties without restriction, or (iv) is independently developed by the
Receiving Party without reference to or reliance on the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as demonstrated by documents or files in existence at the time of disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the
compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.</p>

<h5>14. PROTECTION OF CONFIDENTIAL LICENSEE CONTENT; SECURITY<span style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h5>

<p style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><b>14.1.</b> Codefresh shall maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Licensee Content that is Licensee’s Confidential Information (“<b>Confidential Licensee Content</b>”). Those safeguards shall include, but will not be limited to, measures for preventing access, use, modification, or disclosure of Confidential Licensee Content by Codefresh’s personnel except (a) to provide the Service and prevent or address service or technical problems, (b) as compelled by law in accordance with Section 13 (Confidentiality) above, or (c) as Licensee expressly permits in writing.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><b>14.2.</b> Licensee understands that the operation of the Service, including Licensee Content, may involve (i) transmissions over various networks; (ii) changes to conform and adapt to technical requirements of connecting networks or devices; and (iii) transmission to Codefresh’s third-party vendors and hosting partners solely to
provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Service. Accordingly, Licensee
acknowledges that Licensee bears sole responsibility for adequate backup of Licensee Content. Codefresh will have no liability to Licensee for any unauthorized access or use of any of Licensee Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction, or loss of any of Licensee Content.</p>
