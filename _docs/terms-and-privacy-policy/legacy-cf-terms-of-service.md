<p style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><b>7.4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b>Licensee agrees that its purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Codefresh regarding future functionality or features.</p>

Users failing to use the Service for more than six (6) consecutive months, the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate all User Accounts of Licensee and terminate Licensee’s and all Licensee’s Users’ access to and use of the Service without notice. Upon expiration or termination of an Order or these Terms, Licensee shall immediately be unable access and use the Service, all Licensee Content

terminated) and Licensee shall return or destroy all copies of all Codefresh Content and all portions thereof in Licensee’s possession and so certify to
Codefresh, if such certification is requested by Codefresh. Any provision of these Terms that, by its nature and context is intended to survive, including provisions relation to payment of outstanding fees, confidentiality, warranties, and limitation of liability, will survive termination of these Terms.</p>

<h5>12. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS; LIMITED LICENSES TO CODEFRESH<span style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h5>

<p style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><b>12.1.&nbsp;</b><b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>. Subject to the limited licenses expressly granted hereunder, Codefresh and its licensors reserve their respective right, title, and interest in and to the Service, including all of Codefresh’s and its licensors related intellectual property rights related to the Service (the “<b>Intellectual Property Rights</b>”). No rights are granted to Licensee hereunder other than as expressly set forth herein. Codefresh shall retain all right, title, and interest in and to Intellectual Property Rights, including any Software, all improvements, enhancements, modifications, and derivative works thereof, and all related Intellectual Property Rights. </p>

<p><b>12.2.&nbsp; </span></b><b>License to Host Licensee Content</b>. Licensee hereby grants Codefresh a worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, sublicensable, limited-term license to host, copy, transmit and display Licensee Content that Licensee or any User posts to the Service, solely as necessary for Codefresh to provide the Service in accordance with these Terms. Subject to the limited licenses granted herein, Codefresh acquires no right, title or interest from Licensee or Licensee’s licensors under these Terms in or to Licensee Content.</p>

<h5>13. CONFIDENTIALITY</a><span style='font-weight:normal'>.</span></h5>

<p>Any technical, financial, business or other information provided by one party (the “<b>Disclosing Party</b>”) to the other party (the “<b>Receiving Party</b>”) and designated as confidential or proprietary or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure (“<b>Confidential Information</b>”) shall be held in confidence and not disclosed and shall not be used except to the extent necessary to carry out the Receiving Party’s obligations or express rights hereunder, except as otherwise authorized by the
Disclosing Party in writing. For clarity, the Service and Codefresh Content shall be deemed Confidential Information of Codefresh whether or not otherwise designated as such. The Receiving Party shall use the same degree of care that it uses to protect the confidentiality of its own confidential information of like kind (but not less than a reasonable standard of care). These obligations
will not apply to information that (i) was previously known by the Receiving Party, as demonstrated by documents or files in existence at the time of disclosure, (ii) is generally and freely publicly available through no fault of the Receiving Party, (iii) the Receiving Party otherwise rightfully obtains from third parties without restriction, or (iv) is independently developed by the
Receiving Party without reference to or reliance on the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information, as demonstrated by documents or files in existence at the time of disclosure. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party to the extent compelled by law to do so, provided the Receiving Party gives the Disclosing Party prior notice of the
compelled disclosure (to the extent legally permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party’s cost, if the Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure. If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to disclose the Disclosing Party’s Confidential Information as part of a civil proceeding to which the Disclosing Party is a party, and the Disclosing Party is not contesting the disclosure, the Disclosing Party will reimburse the Receiving Party for its reasonable cost of compiling and providing secure access to that Confidential Information. In the event that such protective order or other remedy is not obtained, the Receiving Party shall furnish only that portion of the Confidential Information that is legally required and use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain assurance that confidential treatment will be accorded the Confidential Information.</p>

<p style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><b>14.1.</b> Codefresh shall maintain administrative, physical, and technical safeguards for protection of the security, confidentiality and integrity of Licensee Content that is Licensee’s Confidential Information (“<b>Confidential Licensee Content</b>”).

provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to operate and maintain the Service. Accordingly, Licensee
acknowledges that Licensee bears sole responsibility for adequate backup of Licensee Content. Codefresh will have no liability to Licensee for any unauthorized access or use of any of Licensee Content, or any corruption, deletion, destruction, or loss of any of Licensee Content.</p>
