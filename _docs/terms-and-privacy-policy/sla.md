# Support Service Objectives

These objectives apply only to actual outages, bugs, errors, or defects in Codefresh-supported products when used in supported configurations. For unsupported issues—such as legacy product versions or unsupported configurations—we may still provide advice, but these SLAs will not apply.

For Premium support customers, these objectives are contractually guaranteed.

## 1.1 Response Time Objectives

The following table outlines our target response times based on priority and support plan:

| **Priority** | **Professional** | **Enterprise** | **Premium**     |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Urgent**   | 2 Business Hours¹ | 1 Hour         | 30 Minutes      |
| **High**     | 6 Business Hours  | 2 Hours        | 1 Hour          |
| **Normal**   | 1 Business Day²   | 4 Hours        | 2 Hours         |
| **Low**      | None              | 2 Business Days| 8 Business Hours|

¹ **Business Hours**: 9am–5pm on Business Days in the registered time zone for your supported product.  
² **Business Day**: Weekdays (excluding public holidays) in your registered time zone.

If a support response would exceed remaining Business Hours in a day, time will resume on the next Business Day. Codefresh may respond outside these hours at its discretion.
