# Support Service Objectives

These objectives apply only to actual outages, bugs, errors, or defects in Codefresh-supported products when used in supported configurations. For unsupported issues—such as legacy product versions or unsupported configurations—we may still provide advice, but these SLAs will not apply.

For Premium support customers, these objectives are contractually guaranteed.

## 1.1 Response Time Objectives

The following table outlines our target response times based on priority and support plan:

| **Priority** | **Professional** | **Enterprise** | **Premium**     |
|--------------|------------------|----------------|-----------------|
| **Urgent**   | 2 Business Hours¹ | 1 Hour         | 30 Minutes      |
| **High**     | 6 Business Hours  | 2 Hours        | 1 Hour          |
| **Normal**   | 1 Business Day²   | 4 Hours        | 2 Hours         |
| **Low**      | None              | 2 Business Days| 8 Business Hours|

¹ **Business Hours**: 9am–5pm on Business Days in the registered time zone for your supported product.  
² **Business Day**: Weekdays (excluding public holidays) in your registered time zone.

If a support response would exceed remaining Business Hours in a day, time will resume on the next Business Day. Codefresh may respond outside these hours at its discretion.

| **Priority Level** | **Description** |
|--------------------|---------------|
| **Urgent**  | A major service outage, e.g.: {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Your Codefresh instance is completely unavailable or unable to deploy.</li><li> Your production use of our products for mission-critical systems has stopped or is so severely impacted that you cannot reasonably continue work.</li></ul>{:/} <br><br> Critical impact problems could have the following characteristics:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>System hangs or crashes</li><li>Data loss or data corruption</li><li>Critical functionality not available</li><li>No reasonable workaround</li></ul>{:/} |
| **High**  | Significant impairment to your ordinary usage, e.g.: {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Disabled functionality, errors that result in a lack of significant functionality in the services which prevent you from accomplishing your deployments with no workaround provided.</li><li>Important product features are unavailable with no acceptable workaround. Your implementation or production use of our product in a primary business service, major application(s), or mission-critical system(s) are functioning with limited capability or are unstable with periodic interruptions. The product may be operating but is severely restricted.</li></ul>{:/} <br><br> High-impact problems could have the following characteristics: {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Product error or failure forcing a restart or recovery.</li><li>Severely degraded performance</li><li>Functionality unavailable, but the system can operate in a restricted fashion.</li></ul>{:/} |
| **Normal**  | Non-critical errors that do not significantly impair your ordinary usage, e.g.: {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Errors that cause previously-working non-critical features to malfunction.</li><li>Product features are unavailable, but a workaround exists, and the majority of product functions are still usable. Minor function/feature failure that the customer can circumvent or avoid.</li><li>Your work has minor loss of operational functionality.</li> </ul>{:/}<br><br>Normal impact problems could have the following characteristics:{::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Error message with a workaround</li><li>Minimal performance degradation</li><li>Incorrect product behavior with a workaround</li></ul>{:/} |
