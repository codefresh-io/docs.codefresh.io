This Service Level Agreement (“**SLA**”) sets forth the terms and conditions under which Codefresh will provide service levels to Licensee and Users pursuant to the applicable Terms of Service in effect between Codefresh and Licensee and/or Users (the “**Terms**”).

##### 1. DEFINITIONS.  
The following definitions will apply to this SLA. All capitalized terms not defined in
this SLA will have the meaning given them in the Terms.  
  

**1.1. “Downtime”** means any time that Codefresh-hosted portions of the Services are not available for access by Users.  
  

**1.2. “Excused Downtime”** means any Downtime that is caused by (i) Maintenance, (ii) Licensee’s or Users’ telecommunications, internet, and network services, (iii) software, hardware, and services not controlled by Codefresh (including but not limited to third-party services used to provide the Services and software or sites that are accessed or linked through the Services), or (iv) any Force Majeure events or other matter beyond Codefresh’s reasonable control.  
  
**1.3. “Maintenance”** means maintenance to the Codefresh Services: (i) that occurs during the time period that Codefresh or its third-party service providers reserve for scheduled maintenance, which will be non-business hours (i.e. not during 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m. Pacific Time, Monday through Friday, excluding those weekdays on which any federal holidays occurs in the United States) and will
not exceed four (4) hours per month; and (ii) any additional maintenance for which Codefresh provides Client with at least two (2) days advance notice.  
  

**1.4. “Uptime”** means any time that is not Downtime.  
  

##### 2. SERVICE AVAILABILITY.  

**2.1. Target Uptime Percentage**. Codefresh will use commercially reasonable efforts to provide at least 99.5% Uptime in any calendar month (the “Target Uptime Percentage”).  
  

**2.2. Achieved Uptime Percentage**. Actual Uptime percentage for each calendar month will be the quotient, expressed as (i) the total minutes potentially available for Uptime for that month minus total minutes of Downtime (other than Excused Downtime), divided by (ii) the total minutes potentially available for Uptime for that month minus any minutes of Excused Downtime (the “Achieved Uptime
Percentage”).  
  
**2.2. Right to Cancel**.

{::nomarkdown}

<p style='margin-left:12px;text-indent:5px'>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event that the Achieved Uptime Percentage is less than the Target Uptime Percentage in three consecutive calendar months (a “<b>Triggering Event</b>”), Client shall have the right to cancel the agreement (the “<b>Cancellation Right</b>”) by providing Codefresh written notice of such cancellation (a “<b>Cancellation Notice</b>”) within 14 days after the last day of the calendar month in which the Triggering Event arose (the “<b>Triggering Month</b>”). If Client does not provide a Cancellation Notice within 14 days after the last day of the Triggering Month, the Cancellation Right arising with respect to the Triggering Event shall expire.</p>


<p style='margin-left:12px;text-indent:5px'>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Exercise of a Cancellation Right pursuant to this SLA will be Client’s sole and exclusive remedy, and the entire liability of Codefresh, for any failure to achieve the Target Uptime Percentage or any breach of this SLA.
