## ERROR PRIORITIES AND RESPONSE TIMES.

Issues with the Codefresh Platform are classified based on severity of the issues and the required resources needed to resolve them. We will designate the severity and impact of the reported issue as defined below and will use commercially reasonable efforts to respond and commence working on the applicable issue in accordance with the time periods below.  The following are our objectives (and - for Premium support customers - our commitment) to responding to your support requests. While we will make our best effort to help, we cannot guarantee any specific results, such as fixing or solving your problem, as this is dependent upon factors outside of our control including your particular software, infrastructure, configurations, and your ability to implement any rectification works such as installing updates or reconfiguring your environment and your own timeframes for doing so.

For Premium support customers, we commit to meeting these objectives as our SLA for our supported products. Please note that if you have multiple products or subscriptions, you must purchase Premium support for all your products and subscriptions. 


These objectives apply only to actual outages, bugs, errors, or defects, in our supported products when used in supported ways. If you report an unsupported issue - for example, the issue lies with an unsupported product (including out-of-date versions of otherwise supported products) or use of a supported product in an unsupported way - these objectives do not apply, but we may provide suggestions on how you can take your own independent steps to remedy your issue. For a list of our supported products, click here. 
  

  

### 1.1. Response Time Objectives. 

Our response may include:
  
* an acknowledgment of receipt of your issue; 
* a request for further information or assistance in order for us to implement or propose a remedy to your issue; 
* implementation or proposal of a remedy for your issue; 
* etc.

The following timeframes are calculated from the time that we receive sufficient information from you in order to designate the severity and impact of the reported issue., through to the time of our response to your support request (or any follow-up reply).

[1] **Business Hours** means the hours of 9am to 5pm on Business Days in the registered time zone for your supported product.
