To configure some other registry which is not officially provided by Codefresh first select **Other Registries** from the new registry drop down and then provide the following:

* Registry Name - A unique name for this configuration
* Username - Your registry username
* Password - Your registry encrypted password
* Domain - Your registry address e.g. `mydomain.com`

{% include image.html lightbox="true" file="/images/artifacts/registry/add-other-docker-registry.png" url="/images/artifacts/registry/add-other-docker-registry.png" alt="Add Other Registries" max-width="60%" %}

You can use this option for any cloud or hosted registry that follows the V2 Docker registry protocol.

Some examples of self-hosted registries are:
