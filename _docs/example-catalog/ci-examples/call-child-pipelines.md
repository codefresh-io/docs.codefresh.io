In Codefresh you can easily create nested pipelines by calling other pipelines from within an existing pipeline. The [codefresh-run plugin](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/codefresh-run){:target="\_blank"} allows you to launch another pipeline, and optionally wait for its completion.

A very common pattern in Codefresh is to have a parent pipeline responsible for Continuous Integration (packaging code), that calls a child pipeline for Continuous Delivery (taking care of deployment).

## Example project

You can see the example project at [https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/call-child-pipeline-sample-app](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/call-child-pipeline-sample-app){:target="\_blank"}. The repository contains a NodeJs app as well as three - one parent and two child pipelines.

## Create a pipeline that calls other pipelines

Here is the definition of the parent pipeline:

 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - prepare
  - package
  - deploy
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: 'Cloning main repository...'
    type: git-clone
    repo: '${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}'
    revision: '${{CF_REVISION}}'
    git: github
    stage: prepare
  read_my_app_version:
    title: Reading Application version
    stage: prepare
    image: node:latest
    commands:
      - export PACKAGE_VERSION=$(node -p "require('./package.json').version")
      - cf_export PACKAGE_VERSION
  build_my_docker_image:
    title: 'Building My Docker Image'
    stage: package
    type: build
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    image_name: my-app-image
    tag: ${{PACKAGE_VERSION}}
  call_qa_pipeline:
    title: Deploy to QA
    stage: deploy
    type: codefresh-run:1.5.3
    arguments:
      PIPELINE_ID: child-pipelines/qa-pipeline
      VARIABLE:
        - CF_BRANCH=${{CF_BRANCH}}
        - CF_REVISION=${{CF_REVISION}}
        - APP_VERSION=${{PACKAGE_VERSION}}
    when:
      branch:
        only:
          - develop      
  call_prod_pipeline:
    title: Deploy to Prod
    stage: deploy
    type: codefresh-run:1.5.3
    arguments:
      PIPELINE_ID: child-pipelines/prod-pipeline
      VARIABLE:
        - CF_BRANCH=${{CF_BRANCH}}
        - CF_REVISION=${{CF_REVISION}}
        - APP_VERSION=${{PACKAGE_VERSION}}
    when:
      branch:
        only:
          - /^release.*/i     
    

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline does the following:

1. Clones the source code through a [Git clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/).
1. Creates a variable that contains the Application version as specified in `package.json` through [cf_export]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#using-cf_export-command).
1. Builds a docker image tagged with the Application version through a [build step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/).
1. Optionally runs the downstream QA pipeline if the branch is named `develop`. It also passes several environment variables to the child pipeline (including the Application version).
1. Optionally runs the downstream Prod pipeline if the branch name starts with `release`. It also passes several environment variables to the child pipeline (including the Application version).

The last two steps use [conditions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/conditional-execution-of-steps/) to decide if they will run or not.
