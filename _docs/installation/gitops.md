The Codefresh GitOps module requires you to install GitOps Runtimes.  

GitOps Runtimes are available as hosted Runtimes with Argo CD installed in the Codefresh cluster, and hybrid Runtimes with Argo CD installed in the customer's cluster. Review the [comparison](#hosted-vshybrid-gitops) between both Runtime modes.


## Hosted GitOps
The SaaS version of GitOps, Hosted GitOps has Argo CD installed in the Codefresh cluster.
Hosted GitOps Runtime is installed and provisioned in a Codefresh cluster, and managed by Codefresh.  
Hosted environments are full-cloud environments, where all updates and improvements are managed by Codefresh, with zero-maintenance overhead for you as the customer.  
Currently, you can add one Hosted GitOps Runtime per account.
For the architecture, see [Hosted GitOps Runtime architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/runtime-architecture/).

  For more information on how to set up the hosted environment, including provisioning hosted runtimes, see [Set up Hosted GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hosted-runtime/).  

## Hybrid GitOps
The hybrid version of GitOps, has Argo CD installed in the customer's cluster.    
Hybrid GitOps is installed in the customer's cluster, and managed by the customer.  
The Hybrid GitOps Runtime is optimal for organizations with security constraints, wanting to manage CI/CD operations within their premises. Hybrid GitOps strikes the perfect balance between security, flexibility, and ease of use. Codefresh maintains and manages most aspects of the platform, apart from installing and upgrading Hybrid GitOps Runtimes which are managed by the customer.
