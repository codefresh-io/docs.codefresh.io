Codefresh supports several modes for working with GitOps applications.

* The easiest way to get started is to use [a hosted GitOps runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hosted-runtime/)
* Alternatively, you can install [a hybrid GitOps runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops/) in your own cluster

You can then add [external clusters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/managed-cluster/) to any runtime (hosted or private).
