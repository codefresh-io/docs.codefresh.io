Codefresh supports several modes to work with GitOps applications:

* The easiest way to get started is to use [a Hosted GitOps Runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hosted-runtime/)
* Alternatively, you can install [a Hybrid GitOps Runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops/) in your own cluster

You can then manage and monitor the Runtimes by adding [external clusters]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/managed-cluster/) and [Git Sources]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/git-sources/).
