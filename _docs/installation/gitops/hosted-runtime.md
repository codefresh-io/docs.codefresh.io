 For GitOps, Codefresh offers the option of installing Hosted and Hybrid GitOps Runtimes.  
 Hosted GitOps Runtimes are fully managed and maintained by Codefresh. 
 
This article describes how to install the Hosted GitOps Runtime to leverage GitOps capabilities.


For Hybrid GitOps Runtime installation, see [Hybrid GitOps Runtime installation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops-helm-installation/).  
For a comparison between the two types of Runtime installations, see [Hosted vs. Hybrid GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/#hosted-vshybrid-gitops).

{{site.data.callout.callout_warning}}
**IMPORTANT**   
Codefresh is responsible for the _availability of Hosted GitOps Runtimes_.<br>
The Argo CD applications created in Hosted GitOps Runtimes are the customer's responsibility. Codefresh Support is happy to assist as needed.

## Where to start with Hosted GitOps Runtimes
If you have not provisioned a Hosted GitOps Runtime, Codefresh presents you with the setup instructions in the **Home** dashboard.   

  

* In the Codefresh UI, from Ops in the sidebar, select [Home](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/?time=LAST_7_DAYS){:target="\_blank"}.  
  Codefresh guides you through the three-step setup, as described below.

max-width="80%"
%}



## Prerequisites
* Set up integrations with the Git provider for the Hosted GitOps Runtime:
  * GitHub
  * Bitbucket Cloud
  * Gerrit

## Step 1: Install Hosted GitOps Runtime
Start installing the Hosted GitOps Runtime with a single-click. Codefresh completes the installation without any further intervention on your part. 
The Hosted GitOps Runtime is provisioned on the Codefresh cluster, and completely managed by Codefresh with automatic version and security upgrades.



1. Do one of the following:  
  * To set up Hosted GitOps Runtime later, click **Install later**, and continue from step _2_.
  * To start setup, click **Install**, and continue from step _3_.

{% include

alt="Step 1: Installing Hosted GitOps Runtime"
caption="Step 1: Installing Hosted GitOps Runtime"
max-width="80%"
%}

{:start="2"}
1. Do the following:  
  * In the Codefresh UI, click the **Settings** icon on the toolbar.
  * From Runtimes in the sidebar, select [**GitOps Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}, and click **+ Add Runtime**.
  * Select **Hosted Runtime** and click **Add**.


{:start="3"}
1. Optional. When complete, click **View Runtime**.  
  * You can see that there are two steps to complete setup for the Hosted GitOps Runtime. 
  * The Runtime Components tab is empty as the Runtime components are hosted and managed by Codefresh.       
    When Argo Rollouts is deployed on target clusters, the Runtime Components tab displays rollout reporters whose manifests are stored in the customer's Shared Configuration Repository created for the Runtime (described in Step 2). 
  * The Git Sources and the Managed Clusters tabs are also empty as they will be set up in the next steps.

max-width="70%"
%}


If you navigate to **Runtimes > List View**, you can identify the Hosted GitOps Runtime through the Type column (Hosted) and the Cluster/Namespace column (Codefresh).

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/runtime/hosted-runtimes-list-view.png"
url="/images/runtime/hosted-runtimes-list-view.png"
alt="Hosted GitOps Runtime in List view"
caption="Hosted GitOps Runtime in List view"
max-width="70%"
%}


## Step 2: Connect Git provider
Connect your Hosted GitOps Runtime to a Git provider for Codefresh to create the required Git repos.  

**Authorize access**  
  Based on the Git provider you select, you need to authorize access through OAuth or an access token, and then select the Git organizations or accounts in which to create the required Git repos. 

**Git organizations/accounts**  
  Only authorized organizations are displayed in the list. To authorize organizations for the Codefresh application in GitHub, see [Authorize organizations/projects]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/hosted-authorize-orgs/).


{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/runtime/hosted-connect-git.png"
url="/images/runtime/hosted-connect-git.png"
alt="Step 2: Connect to Git provider"
caption="Step 2: Connect to Git provider"
max-width="80%"
%}


Once you authorize access, Codefresh creates two Git repositories, one to store the configuration settings for GitOps Runtimes, and the other to store the Runtime's application settings as a Git Source:
* Shared Configuration Repository  
  The Shared Configuration Repository is a centralized Git repository that stores configuration settings for the Hosted GitOps Runtime. Additional Hybrid runtimes provisioned for the account can point to this repo to retrieve and reuse the configuration.  
  Read about [Shared Configuration Repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/shared-configuration/).


* Git Source application repo  
  Codefresh creates a Git Source application repo for every Hosted GitOps Runtime.  
  Read about [Git sources]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/git-sources/).

##### Before you begin
Make sure you have the credentials for the Git provider handy


##### How to 

1. From the list, select the Git provider.
1. Enter the credentials for the selected Git provider:  
    * **Gerrit**:  
      1. **Username**: The username of your Codefresh user account in Gerrit. 
      1. **Password**: Paste the **HTTP Password** you generated and copied into the field.
      1. **Host URL**: The URL of your website with the Gerrit instance, for example, `https://git.company-name.io`.
