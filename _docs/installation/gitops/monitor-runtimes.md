## Monitoring GitOps Runtimes

This article describes the options and actions to monitor GitOps Runtimes after installation through the List and Topology view formats.   
For options on managing GitOps Runtimes, see [Managing GitOps Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/manage-runtimes/).

## GitOps Runtime views

The **Runtimes** page displays the provisioned GitOps Runtimes in your account<!---, both Hybrid Runtimes, and the Hosted Runtime if you have one -->.

View Runtime components and information in List or Topology view formats to monitor them.
* List view: The default view, displays the list of provisioned Runtimes, the clusters managed by them, and Git Sources associated with them.
* Topology view: Displays a hierarchical view of Runtimes and the clusters managed by them, with health and sync status of each cluster.

**TIP**  
Unless specified otherwise, all options are common to both types of GitOps Runtimes. If an option is valid only for Hybrid GitOps, it is indicated as such.

{{site.data.callout.callout_warning}}
**WARNING**
Do not change the Argo CD password by logging into the Argo CD UI with the `argocd-initial-admin-secret`.
Changing the Argo CD password can result in system instability, and disrupt the proper functioning of the Codefresh platform.

## GitOps Runtimes List view

The List view is a grid-view of the provisioned Runtimes.

Here is an example of the List view for runtimes.
{% include
   image.html
   lightbox="true"
   file="/images/runtime/runtime-list-view.png"
 url="/images/runtime/runtime-list-view.png"
  alt="Runtime List View"
  caption="Runtime List View"
  max-width="70%"
%}

Here is a description of the information and options in the List View.

## GitOps Runtimes Topology view

A hierarchical visualization of the provisioned GitOps Runtimes, the Topology view makes it easy to identify key information such as versions, health and sync status, for both the provisioned Runtime and the clusters managed by it.
Here is an example of the Topology view for GitOps Runtimes.
  {% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/runtime/runtime-topology-view.png"
 url="/images/runtime/runtime-topology-view.png"
 alt="Runtime Topology View"
 caption="Runtime Topology View"
  max-width="60%"
%}

Here is a description of the information and options in the Topology view.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Topology View Item      | Description   |
| ------------------------| ---------------- |
|**Runtime**             | ![](../../../../images/icons/runtime-topology-name.png?display=inline-block) the provisioned Runtime. <br>Hybrid Runtimes display the name of the K8s API server endpoint with the cluster. <!--- <br>Hosted Runtimes display 'Codefresh hosted'. --> |
|**Cluster**              | The local, and managed clusters if any, for the Runtime. {::nomarkdown}<ul><li><img src="../../../../images/icons/runtime-topology-in-cluster.png" display=inline-block/> indicates the local cluster, always displayed as `in-cluster`. The in-cluster server URL is always set to `https://kubernetes.default.svc/`.</li><li><img src="../../../../images/icons/runtime-topology-managed-cluster.png" display=inline-block/> indicates a managed cluster.</li> <li> <img src="../../../../images/icons/runtime-topology-add-cluster.png" display=inline-block/> select to add a new managed cluster.</li></ul> {:/} To view cluster components, select the cluster. To add and work with managed clusters, see [Managing external clusters in GitOps Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/managed-cluster/). |
|**Health/Sync status** |The health and sync status of the Runtime or cluster. {::nomarkdown}<ul><li><img src="../../../../images/icons/error.png" display="inline-block"> indicates health or sync errors in the Runtime, or a managed cluster if one was added to the runtime.</br> The runtime or cluster node is bordered in red and the name is colored red.</li> <li><img src="../../../../images/icons/cf-sync-status.png" display=inline-block/> indicates that the Runtime is being synced to the cluster on which it is provisioned.</li></ul> {:/} |
|**Search and View options** | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>Find a Runtime or its clusters by typing part of the Runtime/cluster name, and then navigate to the entries found. </li> <li>Topology view options: Resize to window, zoom in, zoom out, full screen view.</li></ul> {:/}|
