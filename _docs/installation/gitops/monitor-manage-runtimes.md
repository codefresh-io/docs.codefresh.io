Changing the ArgoCD password can result in system instability, and disrupt the proper functioning of the Codefresh platform.




## GitOps Runtime views

View provisioned GitOps Runtimes in List or Topology view formats.

* List view: The default view, displays the list of provisioned Runtimes, the clusters managed by them, and Git Sources associated with them.
* Topology view: Displays a hierarchical view of Runtimes and the clusters managed by them, with health and sync status of each cluster.

### List view

The List view is a grid-view of the provisioned Runtimes.

Here is an example of the List view for runtimes.
{% include

## (Helm Hybrid GitOps) Upgrade GitOps Runtimes

Upgrade provisioned Hybrid GitOps Runtimes to install critical security updates, get new functionality, and the latest versions of all components.
The upgrade procedure differs depending on whether the GitOps Runtime has been configured as an Argo CD application or not:
* Argo CD GitOps Runtimes: For Runtimes configured as Argo CD applications, you need to manually update the version in the Helm chart located in the Shared Configuration Repository.
* Non-Argo CD GitOps Runtimes: Run the upgrade command.

If you have managed clusters for Hybrid GitOps Runtimes, upgrading the Runtime automatically updates runtime components within the managed cluster as well.

>The `Update Available! Notification` in the List View's Version column indicates that a newer version of the Runtime, Helm chart, or both are available.


1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon.
1. From Runtimes in the sidebar, select [**GitOps Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Switch to either the **List View** or to the **Topology View**.
1. **List view**:
    1. To see all the commits to the Runtime, in the Version column, mouse over **Update Available!**, and select **View Complete Change Log**.
    1. Do one of the following:
        * To the right of the row with the Runtime to upgrade, click the context menu and select **Upgrade**.
        * Click the Runtime name, and then click **Upgrade** on the top-right.

{:start="5"}
1. Do one of the following depending on whether you have configured the Runtime as an Argo CD Application or not:
  * Argo CDGitOps Runtimes:Continue from step _6_.
  * Non-Argo CD GitOps Runtimes: Continue from step _7_.
1. For GitOps Runtimes, do the following:
    1. In your Shared Configuration Repository, go to `resources/<runtime_name>/chart`
       where, `<runtime_name>` is the name of the Hybrid GitOps Runtime to upgrade.
    1. In the `chart.yaml`, change the version number in both `.version` and `.dependencies.version`.
    1. Commit the change, and push to your Git server.
```yaml
apiVersion: v2
appVersion: 1.0.0
description: Codefresh gitops runtime umbrella chart
name: codefresh-gitops-runtime
version: <version>
dependencies:
  - name: gitops-runtime
    repository: oci://quay.io/codefresh
    version: <version>
```
1. For non-GitOps Runtimes, do the following:
    1. Copy and run the upgrade command:
        `RELEASE_NAME=$(helm ls -n codefresh-gitops-runtime -q) && helm upgrade ${RELEASE_NAME} -n codefresh-gitops-runtime`
    1. To exit the upgrade panel, click **Close**.

## Update Git credentials for GitOps Runtimes

Provisioned GitOps Runtimes require valid Git Runtime tokens at all times to authenticate and authorize the Runtime.
The Git Runtime token differs from the Git user token which is a personal access token unique to each user. As such, you can use the same Git Runtime token for multiple Runtimes.

>**TIP**:
Git credentials are synced to the Shared Configuration Repository defined during installation. If you change your Git credentials, the Git account must match that of the Shared repo. For example, if the Shared repo is defined as `http://github.com/my-org/isc.git` and the Git provider is defined  as `bitbucket`, the update will fail.

**When to update**
If your Git Runtime token is valid, you can update it at any time by deleting the existing token and replacing it with a new token.

Otherwise, you have to update Git tokens in the following situations:
* **Complete Installation** status displayed in Sync column for Runtime<br>
  You have installed the Runtime but need to update the Git credentials to complete the installation.
* Invalid, revoked, or expired tokens<br>
  Codefresh automatically flags Runtimes with such tokens. It is mandatory to update the Git tokens to continue working with the platform.

**Update methods**<br>
The methods for updating any Git token are the same regardless of the reason for the update:
* OAuth2 authorization, if your admin has registered an OAuth Application for Codefresh.
* Git access token authentication, by generating a Git Runtime token in your Git provider account with the correct scopes.
  You can update your Git Runtime token in the UI or through the CLI.

### Update Git Runtime credentials in Codefresh UI

**Before you begin**
* To authenticate through a Git Runtime token, make sure your token is valid and has [the required scopes]({{site.baseurl}}//docs/security/git-tokens/#git-runtime-token-scopes)

**How to**
1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon.
1. From Runtimes in the sidebar, select [**GitOps Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Switch to either the **List View**.
1. Do one of the following:
  * To the right of the row with the Runtime to update, click the context menu and select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**.
  * Click the Runtime name, click the context-menu on the top-right, and then select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**.

  {% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 url="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 alt="Update Git Runtime credentials"
 caption="Update Git Runtime credentials"
  max-width="60%"
%}

{:start="5"}
1. Do one of the following:
  * If your admin has set up OAuth access, click **Authorize Access to Git Provider**. Go to _step 6_.
  * Alternatively, authenticate with an access token from your Git provider. Go to _step 7_.

{:start="6"}
1. For OAuth2 authorization:
  >**NOTE**:
  >If the application is not registered, you get an error. Contact your admin for help.

      * Enter your credentials, and select **Sign In**.
      * If required, as for example if two-factor authentication is configured, complete the verification.

    {% include
      image.html
      lightbox="true"
      file="/images/administration/user-settings/oauth-user-authentication.png"
      url="/images/administration/user-settings/oauth-user-authentication.png"
      alt="Authorizing access with OAuth2"
      caption="Authorizing access with OAuth2"
      max-width="30%"
   %}

{:start="7"}
1. For Git token authentication, paste the generated token in the **Git runtime token** field.
1. Click **Update Credentials**.

### Update Git Runtime token through CLI
If you are using Git Runtime tokens for authentication, you can also update them through the Codefresh CLI.

* Run:
  `cf config update-gitops-settings --shared-config-repo <repo_url> [--git-provider <git-provider>] [--git-api-url <git-api-url>]`

  where:
  * `<repo_url>` is required, and is the URL of the Shared Configuration Repository, and must match the Git provider.
  * `--git-provider` is optional for cloud providers as Codefresh identifies the provider through the Shared repo URL. Required for on-premises providers, and can be one of the following:
      * GitHub and GitHub Enterprise: `github`
      * GitLab Cloud and GitLab Server: `gitlab`
      * Bitbucket Cloud: `bitbucket`
      * Bitbucket Server: `bitbucket-server`
  * `--git-api-url` is optional for all Git providers, including on-premises repo clones.



## Configure SSH for GitOps Runtimes
By default, Git repositories use the HTTPS protocol. You can also use SSH to connect Git repositories by entering the SSH private key.

>**NOTE**:
When SSH is configured for a GitOps Runtime, when creating/editing Git-Source applications, you can select HTTPS OR SSH as the protocol to connect to the Git repository. See [Repository URL in Application Source definitions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/#source).

**SSH keys**
For more information on generating SSH private keys, see the official documentation:
* [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent){:target="\_blank"}

* [Gerrit](http://ec2-52-87-125-161.compute-1.amazonaws.com:8080/Documentation/user-upload.html#ssh){:target="\_blank"}


**Before you begin**
Copy the SSH private key for your Git provider


**How to**
1. In the Codefresh UI, make sure you are in [GitOps Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. From the **List View**, select the runtime for which to configure SSH.
1. From the context menu with the additional actions on the top-right, select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**.

  {% include

{:start="5"}
1. Click **Update Credentials**.

## Reset Shared Configuration Repository for GitOps Runtimes
Codefresh creates and validates the [Shared Configuration Repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/shared-configuration) when you install the first Hybrid or Hosted GitOps Runtime for your account, and uses it for all GitOps Runtimes you add to the same account.

The Shared Configuration Repo is created in your Git provider account. You can reset the repo defined for your account under the following conditions:

* **Incorrect/missing URL**
  Mandatory when Codefresh notifies you through the UI that the Shared Configuration Repo URL is either incorrect or missing.

    * Incorrect URL
      The Shared Config Repo details provided during installation in Account Setup are incorrect. Codefresh could not connect to the Shared Repo with the details provided.
    * Undefined URL<br>
      You installed the GitOps Runtime through a script or an automated mechanism without providing the URL to the Shared Configuration Repository.


    {% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/runtime/shared-config-repo-missing.png"
 url="/images/runtime/shared-config-repo-missing.png"
 alt="Notification for missing/incorrect Shared Configuration Repository"
 caption="Notification for missing/incorrect Shared Configuration Repository"
  max-width="100%"
%}

* **No active Runtimes**
  If Codefresh has already validated the existing Shared Configuration Repository, meaning that at least one GitOps Runtime successfully connected to it, you _cannot change_ the Shared Configuration Repo URL.
  To do so, you must contact Codefresh Support.

  Otherwise, you can reset the Shared Config Repo URL only _after uninstalling all the GitOps Runtimes in your account_. This option is useful when moving from a temporary account, for example, a POV account, to your organization's official account to reset the URL.

<!--- ### Reset Shared Config Repo via UI
You can reset the Shared Config Repo via the Codefresh UI when you see the notification that the URL is either incorrect or missing.

**Before you begin**

Verify that you have [authorized access to the Codefresh app's organizations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/hosted-authorize-orgs/)


1. Click **Update**.
1. In **Add Shared Configuration Repo**, enter your Git username and the URL at which to create the repo.
1. From the list of **Git Organizations**, select the Git organization for the Codefresh application.

### Reset Shared Config Repo via CLI
You can reset the Shared Configuration Repo via the CLI when:
* You receive the notification that the URL is incorrect or missing
* There are no active GitOps Runtimes in your account.
   To reset the URL for an account with existing GitOps Runtimes, you must [uninstall](#uninstall-gitops-runtimes) all the Runtimes.

-->

**Before you begin**
* Make sure you have no active GitOps Runtimes in your account

**How to**


1. Run `cf config update-gitops-settings --shared-config-repo <shared_repo_url>`
  where:
  `<shared_repo_url>` is the new URL for the Shared Configuration Repository.
1. When prompted, select the Git provider.
1. Confirm to create the Shared Configuration Repo.

## (Hybrid GitOps) Configure Deep Links to applications & resources

Deep Links is an Argo CD feature that redirects users to third-party applications/platforms by surfacing links to the same in Argo CD projects, applications, and resources. Read all about it in [Argo CD Deep Links](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/deep_links/){:target="\_blank"}.

In Codefresh, you can configure deep links to third-party applications/platforms in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap, located in the repo where you installed the Hybrid GitOps Runtime.
When configured, deep links are displayed in the application's Current State tab in Tree view. See [Working with resources in Tree View]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#working-with-resources-in-tree-view).

>Deep link configuration in Codefresh requires Runtime v0.1.27 or higher.



1. Go to the `<hybrid-gitops-installation-repo>/bootstrap/argo-cd/kustomization.yaml`.
1. Configure deep links as in the example below.

```yaml
...
configMapGenerator:
- name: argocd-cm
  behavior: merge
  literals:
  - |
    resource.links:=- url: https://<mycompany>.splunk.com
        title: Splunk
        description: jf
        icon.class: "fa-book"
  - |
    application.links=- url: https://<mycompany>.splunk.com
        title: Splunk
        description: jf
        icon.class: "fa-book"
```

where:

* `<location>:=- url:` defines where the link is displayed and the target URL to link to:
  * `location` can be `application.links` (Application) or `resource.links` (Resource). Codefresh does not show Argo CD projects.
  * `url` is the target URL in the format `https://<url>.com`, for example, `https://codefresh.io.splunk.com`.
* `title`is the display name for the link, as will appear in the UI. For example, `Splunk`.
* `description`is optional, and presents additional info on the link.
* `icon-class` is optional, and is the font-awesome icon class displayed to the left of the `title`.

Argo CD also supports `if` conditional statements to control when the deep links are displayed. When omitted, configured deep links are always displayed.<br>
For more details, read [Configuring Deep Links in Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/deep_links/#configuring-deep-links){:target="\_blank"}.

## (Legacy CLI Hybrid GitOps) Restoring provisioned GitOps Runtimes

In case of cluster failure, restore the provisioned Hybrid GitOps Runtime from the existing runtime installation repository.
For partial or complete cluster failures, you can restore the Runtime to either the failed cluster or to a different cluster.
Restoring the provisioned Runtime reinstalls it, leveraging the resources in the existing Runtime repo.

Restoring the runtime:
* Applies `argo-cd` from the installation manifests in your repo to your cluster
* Associates `argo-cd` with the existing installation repo
* Applies the Runtime and `argo-cd` secrets to the cluster
* Updates the Runtime config map (`<runtime-name>.yaml` in the `bootstrap` directory) with the new cluster configuration for these fields:
  `cluster`
  `ingressClassName`
  `ingressController`
  `ingressHost`

### Restore a Hybrid GitOps Runtime
Reinstall the Hybrid Runtime from the existing installation repository to restore it to the same or a different cluster.

**Before you begin**

* Have the following information handy:
  > All values must be the identical to the Runtime to be restored.
  * Runtime name
  * Repository URL
  * Codefresh context
  * Kube context: Required if you are restoring to the same cluster

**How to**

1. Run:
  `cf runtime install --from-repo`
1. Provide the relevant values when prompted.
1. If you are performing the runtime recovery in a different cluster, verify the ingress resource configuration for `app-proxy`, `workflows`, and `default-git-source`.
  If the health status remains as `Progressing`, do the following:

    * In the Runtime installation repo, check if the `ingress.yaml` files for the `app-proxy` and `workflows` are configured with the correct `host` and `ingressClassName`:

      `apps/app-proxy/overlays/<runtime-name>/ingress.yaml`
      `apps/workflows/overlays/<runtime-name>/ingress.yaml`

    * In the Git Source repository, check the `host` and `ingressClassName` in `cdp-default-git-source.ingress.yaml`:

       `resources_<runtime-name>/cdp-default-git-source.ingress.yaml`

    See the [example](#ingress-example) below.

{:start="4"}
1. If you have managed clusters registered to the hybrid runtime you are restoring, reconnect them.
  Run the command and follow the instructions in the wizard:
  `cf cluster add`

1. Verify that you have a registered Git integration:
  `cf integration git list --runtime <runtime-name>`

1. If needed, create a new Git integration:
  `cf integration git add default --runtime <runtime-name> --provider github --api-url https://api.github.com`

### Ingress example
This is an example of the `ingress.yaml` for `workflows`.

 ```yaml
apiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1
kind: Ingress
metadata:
  annotations:
    ingress.kubernetes.io/protocol: https
    ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/backend-protocol: https
    nginx.ingress.kubernetes.io/rewrite-target: /$2
  creationTimestamp: null
  name: runtime-name-workflows-ingress
  namespace: runtime-name
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx
  rules:
  - host: your-ingress-host.com
    http:
      paths:
      - backend:
          service:
            name: argo-server
            port:
              number: 2746
        path: /workflows(/|$)(.*)
        pathType: ImplementationSpecific
status:
  loadBalancer: {}
```

## (Hybrid GitOps) Troubleshoot communication problems

You have a communication problem if you see either of these notifications:
_Unable to communicate with a `runtime_name`_
OR
 _Unable to communicate with two or more runtimes_

Refer to our [troubleshooting section]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/kb/articles/runtime-issues/#unable-to-communicate-with-runtime-name-or-two-or-more-runtimes) for a list of possible causes and the corresponding corrective actions.


## (Hybrid GitOps) View notifications in Activity Log

The Activity Log is a quick way to monitor notifications for Runtime events such as upgrades. A pull-down panel in the Codefresh toolbar, the Activity Log shows ongoing, success, and error notifications, sorted by date, starting with today's date.

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the top-right of the toolbar, select  **Activity Log**.
1. To see notifications for provisioned Runtimes, filter by **Runtime**.
