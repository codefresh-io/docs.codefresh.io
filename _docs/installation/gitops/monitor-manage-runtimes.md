## GitOps Runtime views

View provisioned GitOps Runtimes in List or Topology view formats.  

* List view: The default view, displays the list of provisioned Runtimes, the clusters managed by them, and Git Sources associated with them.
* Topology view: Displays a hierarchical view of Runtimes and the clusters managed by them, with health and sync status of each cluster.

### List view

The List view is a grid-view of the provisioned Runtimes.  

Here is an example of the List view for runtimes.
{% include
   image.html
   lightbox="true"
   file="/images/runtime/runtime-list-view.png"
 url="/images/runtime/runtime-list-view.png"
  alt="Runtime List View"
  caption="Runtime List View"
  max-width="70%"
%}

Here is a description of the information in the List View.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| List View Item|  Description   |

### Configure SSH for GitOps Runtimes
By default, Git repositories use the HTTPS protocol. You can also use SSH to connect Git repositories by entering the SSH private key.

>When SSH is configured for a runtime, when creating/editing Git-Source applications, you can select HTTPS OR SSH as the protocol to connect to the Git repository. See [Repository URL in Application Source definitions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/#source).

**SSH keys**  
For more information on generating SSH private keys, see the official documentation:
* [GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent){:target="\_blank"}
* [GitLab](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/ssh/#generating-a-new-ssh-key-pair){:target="\_blank"}
* [Bitbucket](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/set-up-an-ssh-key-728138079.html){:target="\_blank"}
* [Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/use-ssh-keys-to-authenticate?view=azure-devops&tabs=current-page){:target="\_blank"}

**Before you begin**  
Copy the SSH private key for your Git provider  


**How to**  
1. In the Codefresh UI, make sure you are in [GitOps Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. From the **List View**, select the runtime for which to configure SSH.
1. From the context menu with the additional actions on the top-right, select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**. 

  {% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"

 url="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 alt="Update Git runtime credentials"
 caption="Update Git runtime credentials"
  max-width="60%"
%}

{:start="4"}
1. Expand **Connect Repo using SSH**, and then paste the raw SSH private key into the field.

  max-width="40%"
%}

{:start="5"}
1. Click **Update Credentials**.

### (Hybrid GitOps) Configure Deep Links to applications & resources

Deep Links is an Argo CD feature that redirects users to third-party applications/platforms by surfacing links to the same in Argo CD projects, applications, and resources. Read all about it in [Argo CD Deep Links](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/deep_links/){:target="\_blank"}.

In Codefresh, you can configure deep links to third-party applications/platforms in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap, located in the repo to which you installed the Hybrid GitOps runtime.  
When configured, deep links are displayed in the application's Current State tab, in Tree view. See [Working with resources in Tree View]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#working-with-resources-in-tree-view).

>Deep link configuration in Codefresh requires runtime v0.1.27 or higher.



1. Go to the `<hybrid-gitops-installation-repo>/bootstrap/argo-cd/kustomization.yaml`.
1. Configure deep links as in the example below. 

```yaml
...
configMapGenerator:
- name: argocd-cm
  behavior: merge
  literals:
  - |
    resource.links:=- url: https://<mycompany>.splunk.com
        title: Splunk
        description: jf
        icon.class: "fa-book"
  - |
    application.links=- url: https://<mycompany>.splunk.com
        title: Splunk
        description: jf
        icon.class: "fa-book"
```

where:  

* `<location>:=- url:` defines where the link is displayed and the target URL to link to:  
      * `location` can be `application.links` (Application) or `resource.links` (Resource). Codefresh does not show Argo CD projects. 
      * `url` is the target URL in the format `https://<url>.com`, for example, `https://codefresh.io.splunk.com`.
* `title`is the display name for the link, as will appear in the UI. For example, `Splunk`.
* `description`is optional, and presents additional info on the link.
* `icon-class` is optional, and is the font-awesome icon class displayed to the left of the `title`.

Argo CD also supports `if` conditional statements to control when the deep links are displayed. When omitted, configured deep links are always displayed.<br>
For more details, read [Configuring Deep Links in Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/deep_links/#configuring-deep-links){:target="\_blank"}.

### Reset shared configuration repository for GitOps Runtimes
Codefresh creates the [shared configuration repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/reference/shared-configuration) when you install the first hybrid or hosted GitOps runtime for your account, and uses it for all runtimes you add to the same account.

If needed, you can reset the location of the shared configuration repository in your account and re-initialize it. For example, when moving from evaluation to production.  
Uninstall all the existing runtimes in your account, and then run the reset command. On the next installation, Codefresh re-initializes the shared configuration repo.

**Before you begin**   
[Uninstall every runtime in the account](#uninstall-provisioned-gitops-runtimes)

**How to**  
* Run:  
  `cf config reset-shared-config-repo`


### (Hybrid GitOps) Upgrade provisioned Runtimes

Upgrade provisioned Hybrid Runtimes to install critical security updates or the latest versions of all components. Upgrade a provisioned Hybrid Runtime by running a silent upgrade or through the GitOps CLI wizard.  
If you have managed clusters for Hybrid GitOps, upgrading the Runtime automatically updates runtime components within the managed cluster as well.

> When there are security updates, the UI displays the alert, _At least one runtime requires a security update_. The Version column displays an _Update Required!_ notification.  

> If you have older Hybrid Runtime versions, upgrade to manually define or create the shared configuration repo for your account. See [Shared configuration repo]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/reference/shared-configuration/).


**Before you begin**  
For both silent or CLI-wizard based upgrades, make sure you have:  

* The latest version of the Codefresh CLI   
* A valid Git token with [the required scopes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/reference/git-tokens) 

**Silent upgrade**  

* Pass the mandatory flags in the upgrade command:  

  `cf runtime upgrade <runtime-name> --git-token <git-token> --silent`
  where:  
  `<git-token>` is a valid Git token with the correct scopes.

**CLI wizard-based upgrade**

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, expand Runtimes in the sidebar, and select [**GitOps Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Switch to either the **List View** or to the **Topology View**.  
1. **List view**:  
  * Select the Runtime name.
  * To see all the commits to the Runtime, in the Version column, mouse over **Update Available!**, and select **View Complete Change Log**.
  * On the top-right, select **Upgrade**.

<!---### (Hybrid) Migrate ingress-less runtimes
To migrate an ingress-less runtime to an ingress-based one, you must uninstall the ingress-less runtime and then install a runtime with an ingress controller. 
You can retain the installation repo used to install the ingress-less runtime. Though empty after uninstalling the ingress-less The new installation creates the new manifests in this re


>Before uninstalling the ingress-less runtime, you can save specific patches in a temporary location or retrieve the same from the Git history, and re-apply them after installing the ingress-based runtime.

**Before you begin**  
* Make sure the ingress controller for the new runtime meets [requirements and is configured as needed]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/runtime/requirements/)

**How to**  
1. Uninstall the ingress-less runtime, as described in [Uninstall provisioned runtimes](#uninstall-provisioned-runtimes) in this article.
2. Install the new ingress-based runtime, as described in [Install hybrid runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/runtime/installation/).

### Uninstall provisioned GitOps Runtimes

Uninstall provisioned GitOps Runtimes that are not in use, through a silent uninstall or through the GitOps CLI wizard.  
> Uninstalling a Runtime removes the Git Sources and managed clusters associated with it.

**Before you begin**  
For both types of uninstalls, make sure you have:  

* The latest version of the GitOps CLI
* A valid runtime Git token
* The Kube context from which to uninstall the provisioned Runtime

**Silent uninstall**  
Pass the mandatory flags in the uninstall command:  
  `cf runtime uninstall <runtime-name> --git-token <git-token> --silent`  
  where:

1. Select the Kube context from which to uninstall the Runtime, and then confirm the uninstall.
1. If you get errors, run the uninstall command again, with the `--force` flag.



### Update Git tokens for Runtimes

Provisioned Runtimes require valid Git tokens at all times to authenticate Git actions by you as a user.  
>These tokens are specific to the user, and the same can be used for multiple runtimes.

There are two different situations when you need to update Git tokens:  
* Invalid, revoked, or expired tokens: Codefresh automatically flags Runtimes with such tokens. It is mandatory to update the Git tokens to continue working with the platform. 
* Valid tokens: Optional. You may want to update Git tokens, even valid ones, by deleting the existing token and replacing it with a new token.

The methods for updating any Git token are the same regardless of the reason for the update:  
* OAuth2 authorization, if your admin has registered an OAuth Application for Codefresh
* Git access token authentication, by generating a personal access token in your Git provider account with the correct scopes

**Before you begin**  
* To authenticate through a Git access token, make sure your token is valid and has [the required scopes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/reference/git-tokens) 

**How to**
1. Do one of the following:
  * If you see a notification in the Codefresh UI about invalid Runtime tokens,  click **[Update Token]**.
    The GitOps Runtimes page shows runtimes with invalid tokens prefixed by the key icon. Mouse over shows invalid token.
  * To update an existing token, go to [GitOps Runtimes](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Select the GitOps Runtime for which to update the Git token.
1. From the context menu at the right, select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**.

  {% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 url="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 alt="Update Git runtime token option"
 caption="Update Git runtime token option"
  max-width="40%"
%}

{:start="4"}
1. Do one of the following: 
  * If your admin has set up OAuth access, click **Authorize Access to Git Provider**. Go to _step 5_.
  * Alternatively, authenticate with an access token from your Git provider. Go to _step 6_.

{:start="5"}  
1. For OAuth2 authorization:
  > If the application is not registered, you get an error. Contact your admin for help.  
  * Enter your credentials, and select **Sign In**.
  * If required, as for example if two-factor authentication is configured, complete the verification. 

    {% include 
      image.html

### (Hybrid GitOps) Restoring provisioned Runtimes

In case of cluster failure, restore the provisioned Hybrid Runtime from the existing runtime installation repository.  
For partial or complete cluster failures, you can restore the Runtime to either the failed cluster or to a different cluster.  
Restoring the provisioned Runtime reinstalls it, leveraging the resources in the existing Runtime repo.

Restoring the runtime:
* Applies `argo-cd` from the installation manifests in your repo to your cluster
* Associates `argo-cd` with the existing installation repo
* Applies the Runtime and `argo-cd` secrets to the cluster
* Updates the Runtime config map (`<runtime-name>.yaml` in the `bootstrap` directory) with the new cluster configuration for these fields:  
  `cluster`  
  `ingressClassName`  
  `ingressController`  
  `ingressHost` 

{::nomarkdown}
<br><br>
{:/}

#### Restore a Hybrid Runtime
Reinstall the Hybrid Runtime from the existing installation repository to restore it to the same or a different cluster.  

**Before you begin**

* Have the following information handy: 
  > All values must be the identical to the Runtime to be restored. 
  * Runtime name
  * Repository URL
  * Codefresh context
  * Kube context: Required if you are restoring to the same cluster

**How to**

1. Run:  
  `cf runtime install --from-repo`
1. Provide the relevant values when prompted.
1. If you are performing the runtime recovery in a different cluster, verify the ingress resource configuration for `app-proxy`, `workflows`, and `default-git-source`.  
  If the health status remains as `Progressing`, do the following:
  
    * In the Runtime installation repo, check if the `ingress.yaml` files for the `app-proxy` and `workflows` are configured with the correct `host` and `ingressClassName`:  

      `apps/app-proxy/overlays/<runtime-name>/ingress.yaml`  
      `apps/workflows/overlays/<runtime-name>/ingress.yaml`  

    * In the Git Source repository, check the `host` and `ingressClassName` in `cdp-default-git-source.ingress.yaml`: 

       `resources_<runtime-name>/cdp-default-git-source.ingress.yaml`  
    
    See the [example](#ingress-example) below. 

{:start="4"}
1. If you have managed clusters registered to the hybrid runtime you are restoring, reconnect them.  
  Run the command and follow the instructions in the wizard:  
  `cf cluster add`

1. Verify that you have a registered Git integration:  
  `cf integration git list --runtime <runtime-name>`  

1. If needed, create a new Git integration:  
  `cf integration git add default --runtime <runtime-name> --provider github --api-url https://api.github.com`

#### Ingress example
This is an example of the `ingress.yaml` for `workflows`.

 ```yaml

  creationTimestamp: null
  name: runtime-name-workflows-ingress
  namespace: runtime-name
spec:
  ingressClassName: nginx

### (Hybrid GitOps) Troubleshoot communication problems

A notification _Unable to communicate with a <runtime_name>_ or _Unable to communicate with two or more runtimes_ indicates a communication problem.

Refer to our [troubleshooting section]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/kb/articles/runtime-issues/#unable-to-communicate-with-runtime-name-or-two-or-more-runtimes) for a list of possible causes and the corresponding corrective actions. 


### (Hybrid GitOps) View notifications in Activity Log

The Activity Log is a quick way to monitor notifications for Runtime events such as upgrades. A pull-down panel in the Codefresh toolbar, the Activity Log shows ongoing, success, and error notifications, sorted by date, starting with today's date.

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the top-right of the toolbar, select  **Activity Log**.
1. To see notifications for provisioned Runtimes, filter by **Runtime**.


  <!--- ask dev for help -->
  {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/runtime/runtime-activity-log.png"
  url="/images/runtime/runtime-activity-log.png"
  alt="Activity Log filtered by Runtime events"
  caption="Activity Log filtered by Runtime events"
  max-width="30%"
  %}

{:start="3"}

1. To see more information on an error, select the **+** sign.

### (Hybrid GitOps) Troubleshoot health and sync errors for Runtimes
The ![](/images/icons/error.png?display=inline-block) icon with the Runtime in red indicates either health or sync errors.

**Health errors**  
Health errors are generated by Argo CD and by Codefresh for Runtime components.

**Sync errors**  
Runtimes with sync errors display an **Out of sync** status in Sync Status column. They are related to discrepancies between the desired and actual state of a Runtime component or one of the Git sources associated with the Runtime.  

**View errors**  
For both views, select the Runtime, and then select **Errors Detected**.  
Here is an example of health errors for a Runtime.
  <!--- ask dev for help -->
    {% include image.html 
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/runtime/runtime-health-sync-errors.png"
  url="/images/runtime/runtime-health-sync-errors.png"
  alt="Health errors for runtime example"
  caption="Health errors for runtime example"
  max-width="30%"
  %}
