## Managing GitOps Runtimes
This article describes the options and actions to manage GitOps Runtimes after installation, including configuring the Runtime as an application, updating Git credentials, and more.  
For options on monitoring GitOps Runtimes, see [Monitoring GitOps Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/monitor-runtimes/).



## Configure Runtime as Argo CD application

Configure the Hybrid GitOps Runtime as an Argo CD Application.  This is usually done when installing the Runtime. 
You can configure the Runtime when needed after installation.

Configuring the Runtime as an Argo CD application, allows you to: 
* View the Runtime components, monitor health and sync statuses, and ensure that GitOps is the single source of truth for the Runtime.
* View and its resources, services, and deployment history in the GitOps Apps dashboard through the **Runtime Application** option in the Runtime's context menu



##### How to

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon.
1. From the sidebar, select **GitOps Runtimes**.
1. Switch to the **List View**.
1. Select the Hybrid GitOps Runtime to configure as an Argo CD application.
1. In the Runtime Component tab, in **3: Configure runtime as an Argo Application**, click **Configure**.

      alt="Configuring GitOps Runtime as an Argo CD Application" 
      caption="Configuring GitOps Runtime as an Argo CD Application"
      max-width="60%" 
   %}

The Runtime's context menu now includes the **Runtime Application** option, which when selected takes you to the Current State tab in the GitOps Apps dashboard.

      caption="Runtime Application option to view and monitor resources"
      max-width="60%" 
   %}

## Upgrade GitOps Runtimes

Upgrade provisioned Hybrid GitOps Runtimes to install critical security updates, new functionality, and the latest versions of all components. 

>**NOTE**  
For details on Argo CD versions and their compatible Kubernetes versions, see [Argo CD versioning information](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/upgrading/overview/){:target="\_block"} and [Kubernetes tested versions](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/installation/#tested-versions){:target="\_block"}. 

**Changelog for new versions**  
Codefresh alerts you to newer versions of Runtimes, through `Update Available! Notification` in the List View's Version column. A new version of the GtiOps Runtime includes a link to the changelog, detailing the changes in that version.  
See also [View changelogs for GitOps Runtimes](#view-changelogs-for-gitops-runtimes).

**Upgrade procedure**   
The upgrade procedure differs slightly depending on whether the GitOps Runtime has been configured as an Argo CD application or not:<br>
* For Runtimes configured as Argo CD applications, you need to manually update the version in the Helm chart located in the Shared Configuration Repository.
* For other Runtimes, run the upgrade command.

{{site.data.callout.callout_tip}}
**TIP**  
If you have managed clusters for Hybrid GitOps Runtimes, upgrading the Runtime automatically updates runtime components within the managed cluster as well.
{{site.data.callout.end}}

##### How to
1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon.
1. From the sidebar, select [**GitOps Runtimes**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/account-settings/runtimes){:target="\_blank"}.

## Enable precise sync detection for monorepo apps
Enable the ACR Controller in GitOps Runtimes to precisely detect sync operations that triggered deployments for applications in monorepo setups.

When enabled, the ACR Controller:
* Identifies and tracks application-specific changes by analyzing the applicationâ€™s source path.
* Compares revisions to identify the specific sync operation that triggered the promotion or deployment.
* Automatically adds the `.app.status.operationState.operation.sync.changeRevision` to application manifests. 

To trigger and customize notifications for the identified revision, update the notification controller and configure the notification template accordingly.

##### How to

{::nomarkdown}
<ol>
  <li>If needed, upgrade your Runtime to version 0.13.0 or higher.</li>
  <li>In the Runtime's <code class="highlighter-rouge">values.yaml</code>, enable the ACR controller by adding the following to the <code class="highlighter-rouge">argo-cd</code> section:
    <pre><code>argo-cd:
  acrController:
    enabled: true
</code></pre>
  </li>
  <li>In the notification controller, switch the revision being used to <code class="highlighter-rouge">.app.status.operationState.operation.sync.changeRevision</code>.<br>
    Here's an example with the new notification trigger:<br>
   {% highlight yaml %}
    {% raw %}
    trigger.on-deployed: |
      - description: Application is synced and healthy. Triggered once per commit.
        when: app.status.health.status == 'Healthy' and app.status.operationState != nil and app.status.operationState.operation.sync.changeRevision != nil and app.status.operationState.phase in ['Succeeded']
        oncePer: app.status.operationState.operation.sync.changeRevision
        send:
          - app-deployed
  {% endraw %}
  {% endhighlight %}
  </li>
  <li>
    Configure the notification template to report the <code class="highlighter-rouge">changeRevision</code>, as in the example below:
    {% highlight yaml %}
    {% raw %}
    message: "Author: {{(call .repo.GetCommitMetadata .app.status.operationState.operation.sync.changeRevision).Author}}, message: {{(call .repo.GetCommitMetadata .app.status.operationState.operation.sync.changeRevision).Message}}"
    {% endraw %}
     {% endhighlight %}
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't receive notifications, see <a href="https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/deployments/gitops/troubleshooting-gitops-apps/#not-receiving-application-scoped-sync-notifications-with-acr-controller">Not receiving application-scoped sync notifications with ACR Controller</a>.
  </li>
</ol>

## Rollback GitOps Runtimes
After upgrading a GitOps Runtime, roll back to the previous or a specific version of the Runtime.  
The rollback procedure differs slightly depending on whether the GitOps Runtime has been configured as an Argo CD application or not.

##### Rollback GitOps Runtimes configured as Argo CD applications
Manually change the version in the Helm chart (`chart.yaml`) located in the Shared Configuration Repository.

1. In your Shared Configuration Repository, go to:  
  `resources/<runtime_name>/chart`  
  where:  
  `<runtime_name>` is the name of the Hybrid GitOps Runtime to upgrade.
1. In `chart.yaml`, change the version number in both `.version` and `.dependencies.version`.
1. Commit the change, and push to your Git server.

##### Rollback other GitOps Runtimes  
Rollback GitOps Runtimes not configured as Argo CD applications using Helm commands such as `rollback` or `upgrade`.

If you need details, see the documentation on [Helm commands](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_init/){:target="\_blank"}.



## Update Git credentials for GitOps Runtimes

Provisioned GitOps Runtimes require valid Git Runtime tokens at all times to authenticate and authorize the Runtime.
The Git Runtime token differs from the Git user token which is a personal access token unique to each user. As such, you can use the same Git Runtime token for multiple Runtimes.

{{site.data.callout.callout_tip}}
**TIP**  
Git credentials are synced to the Shared Configuration Repository defined during installation. If you change your Git credentials, the Git account must match that of the Shared repo. For example, if the Shared repo is defined as `http://github.com/my-org/isc.git` and the Git provider is defined  as `bitbucket`, the update will fail.
{{site.data.callout.end}}


**When to update**  
If your Git Runtime token is valid, you can update it at any time by deleting the existing token and replacing it with a new token.

Otherwise, you have to update Git tokens in the following situations:
* **Complete Installation** status displayed in Sync column for Runtime<br>
  You have installed the Runtime but need to update the Git credentials to complete the installation.
* Invalid, revoked, or expired tokens<br>
  Codefresh automatically flags Runtimes with such tokens. It is mandatory to update the Git tokens to continue working with the platform.

**Update methods**<br>
The methods for updating any Git token are the same regardless of the reason for the update:
* OAuth2 authorization, if your admin has registered an OAuth Application for Codefresh.
* Git access token authentication, by generating a Git Runtime token in your Git provider account with the correct scopes.
  You can update your Git Runtime token in the UI or through the CLI.

### Update Git Runtime credentials in Codefresh UI

**Before you begin**
* To authenticate through a Git Runtime token, make sure your token is valid and has the [required scopes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/security/git-tokens/#git-runtime-token-scopes)

**How to**
1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon.
1. From the sidebar, select **GitOps Runtimes**.
1. Switch to the **List View**.
1. Do one of the following:
  * To the right of the row with the Runtime to update, click the context menu and select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**.
  * Click the Runtime name, click the context-menu on the top-right, and then select **Update Git Runtime Credentials**.

  {% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 url="/images/runtime/update-git-runtime-token.png"
 alt="Update Git Runtime credentials"
 caption="Update Git Runtime credentials"
  max-width="60%"
%}

{:start="5"}
1. Do one of the following:
  * If your admin has set up OAuth access, click **Authorize Access to Git Provider**. Go to _step 6_.
  * Alternatively, authenticate with an access token from your Git provider. Go to _step 7_.

{:start="6"}
1. For OAuth2 authorization:
  >**NOTE**  
  If the application is not registered, you get an error. Contact your admin for help.

      * Enter your credentials, and select **Sign In**.
      * If required, as for example if two-factor authentication is configured, complete the verification.

    {% include
      image.html
      lightbox="true"
      file="/images/administration/user-settings/oauth-user-authentication.png"
      url="/images/administration/user-settings/oauth-user-authentication.png"
      alt="Authorizing access with OAuth2"
      caption="Authorizing access with OAuth2"
      max-width="30%"
   %}

{:start="7"}
1. For Git token authentication, paste the generated token in the **Git runtime token** field.
1. Click **Update Credentials**.

### Update Git Runtime token through CLI
If you are using Git Runtime tokens for authentication, you can also update them through the Codefresh CLI.

* Run:
  `cf config update-gitops-settings --shared-config-repo <repo_url> [--git-provider <git-provider>] [--git-api-url <git-api-url>]`

  where:
  * `<repo_url>` is required, and is the URL of the Shared Configuration Repository, and must match the Git provider.
  * `--git-provider` is optional for cloud providers as Codefresh identifies the provider through the Shared repo URL. Required for on-premises providers, and can be one of the following:
      * GitHub and GitHub Enterprise: `github`
      * GitLab Cloud and GitLab Server: `gitlab`
      * Bitbucket Cloud: `bitbucket`
      * Bitbucket Server: `bitbucket-server`
  * `--git-api-url` is optional for all Git providers, including on-premises repo clones.



## Configure SSH for GitOps Runtimes
By default, Git repositories use the HTTPS protocol. You can also use SSH to connect Git repositories by entering the SSH private key.

>**NOTE**  
When SSH is configured for a GitOps Runtime, when creating/editing Git-Source applications, you can select HTTPS OR SSH as the protocol to connect to the Git repository. See [Repository URL in Application Source definitions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/#source).

**SSH keys**

  The file is downloaded as `<component-name>.log`.

## Reset Shared Configuration Repository for GitOps Runtimes
When you install the first Hybrid <!--- or Hosted--> GitOps Runtime for your account, as part of the setup, Codefresh creates the [Shared Configuration Repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/shared-configuration/) in your Git provider account and validates the URL. The Shared Configuration Repo is used for all GitOps Runtimes you add to the same account.

As a Codefresh admin, you can reset the repo defined for your account if the URL is either incorrect or missing, or if there are no active GitOps Runtimes. See [Reset Shared Configuration Repo]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/shared-configuration/#reset-shared-configuration-repo).



## Configure Deep Links to applications & resources

Deep Links is an Argo CD feature that redirects users to third-party applications/platforms by surfacing links to the same in Argo CD projects, applications, and resources. Read all about it in [Argo CD Deep Links](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/deep_links/){:target="\_blank"}.

In Codefresh, you can configure deep links to third-party applications/platforms in the `argocd-cm` ConfigMap, located in the repo where you installed the Hybrid GitOps Runtime.
When configured, deep links are displayed in the application's Current State tab in Tree view. See [Working with resources in Tree View]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#working-with-resources-in-tree-view).

>**NOTE**  
Deep link configuration in Codefresh requires Runtime v0.1.27 or higher.



1. Go to the `<hybrid-gitops-installation-repo>/bootstrap/argo-cd/kustomization.yaml`.
1. Configure deep links as in the example below.

```yaml
...
configMapGenerator:
- name: argocd-cm
  behavior: merge
  literals:
  - |
    resource.links:=- url: https://<mycompany>.splunk.com
        title: Splunk
        description: jf
        icon.class: "fa-book"
  - |
    application.links=- url: https://<mycompany>.splunk.com
        title: Splunk
        description: jf
        icon.class: "fa-book"
```

where:

* `<location>:=- url:` defines where the link is displayed and the target URL to link to:
  * `location` can be `application.links` (Application) or `resource.links` (Resource). Codefresh does not show Argo CD projects.
  * `url` is the target URL in the format `https://<url>.com`, for example, `https://codefresh.io.splunk.com`.
* `title`is the display name for the link, as will appear in the UI. For example, `Splunk`.
* `description`is optional, and presents additional info on the link.
* `icon-class` is optional, and is the font-awesome icon class displayed to the left of the `title`.

Argo CD also supports `if` conditional statements to control when the deep links are displayed. When omitted, configured deep links are always displayed.<br>
For more details, read [Configuring Deep Links in Argo CD](https://argo-cd.readthedocs.io/en/stable/operator-manual/deep_links/#configuring-deep-links){:target="\_blank"}.
