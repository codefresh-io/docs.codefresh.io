Codefresh has two different CLIs, one for Codefresh pipelines, and one for Codefresh GitOps.

##### Codefresh CLI for pipelines
Interact with Codefresh through the CLI and:
* Perform any UI operation
* Create complex automation from your local machine
* Create and run pipelines for complex use cases using the CLI within pipeline steps

For installation instructions and CLI command descriptions, see the [CLI documentation](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/getting-started/){:target="\_blank"}.

<br />

##### GitOps CLI 
Keep up to date with the latest features through the GitOps CLI.  
The GitOps CLI is required to install the Shared Configuration Repository for GitOps runtimes.   
Upgrade is easy as you don't have to keep track of the different versions. The GitOps CLI automatically checks its own version and prints a banner if there is a newer version.  

For details, see [Download/Upgrade the GitOps CLI]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/upgrade-gitops-cli/).
