Codefresh account administrators can toggle specific features of the Codefresh platform on/off in on-premises environments. Feature management helps you to easily implement and manage functionality on an as- and when-needed basis. 

You can enable or disable features for:
1. A single account
1. Specific accounts
1. All accounts in the organization 




## Enable/disable features in on-premises platforms
Enable a feature for all accounts, or override the default setting and enable/disable the feature selectively for specific accounts. Account-level feature overrides are retained when you change the default setting for the feature. 
Review the [feature list](#on-premises-feature-list) to understand the implications of enabling a feature.

1. Sign in to Codefresh.
1. On the top-right, click your avatar and then select **Admin Panel**.
1. From the sidebar, click **Feature Management**. 
1. To enable a feature for _all accounts_ under **Enable**, toggle the required feature to **ON**. 
1. To enable or disable the feature for _a single account or for specific accounts_, click the **Edit** icon, and then select the accounts from the **Enable feature for** and **Disable feature for** lists, as required.

## System Features
System Features are generally only for internal use, and should not be changed. For more information, see [Enable System Features]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/on-premises/on-prem-configuration/#enable-system-features).

{{site.data.callout.callout_warning}}
**IMPORTANT**  
Codefresh _strongly recommends against enabling System Features_ unless you are familiar with the implications of turning on a System Feature. <br> 
If you need to turn on a System Feature, we recommend to first contact Codefresh support.

## On-premises feature list 

Here is an example of the Feature Management page in Admin Management for the organization. Any feature enabled or disabled in this page affects all Codefresh accounts in the organization.
