Enable features to open them for this account. You can either enable features for the account you are currently logged into, or selectively for additional accounts. 

>**IMPORTANT**:  
System Features are generally for internal use.  
Codefresh strongly recommends against enabling these features and using them unless you are familiar with the implications of each feature.  
We recommend with Codefresh support as shpwn in the warning.

## Step 5: Set login options for account
Control the login mechanisms available for users in this account, from among Git providers, IdPs, SSO providers, and Codefresh for username-password login.

By default, all login mechanisms are enabled, and users will see all the options in the Sign-In page.  


To use Codefresh login, User/Pass must be enabled for the account.
