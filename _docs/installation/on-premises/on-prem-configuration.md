  max-width="50%"
    %}  

{:start="4"}
1. Continue with [Step 2: Add a Codefresh account](#step-2-add-a-codefresh-account).


### Step 2: Add a Codefresh account 
Before creating projects and pipelines, add Codefresh accounts for your organization.  

Only those settings required for initial set up are described here.  
For a description of all settings available for a Codefresh account, see [Quick reference: Account settings](#quick-reference-account-settings) in this article.

1. From your avatar dropdown, select **Admin Management**.

{% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/select-admin-panel.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/select-admin-panel.png"
  alt="Admin Management for on-premises"
  caption="Admin Management for on-premises"
  max-width="50%"
    %} 

{:start="2"}
1. From the sidebar, select **Accounts**.  
  The Accounts page displays two default accounts, the `codefresh-system-account` and the `admin-cf account`. 
 
 {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/admin-accounts-page.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/admin-accounts-page.png"
  alt="Account setup and management for on-premises"
  caption="Account setup management for on-premises"
  max-width="70%"
    %} 

{:start="3"}
1. In the toolbar on the right, click the **+** icon.
1. In **Create New Account**, enter the account name and click **Create**.  
  The new account is displayed in the list of Accounts.
1. Click the **System Type** column, and do the following:
  1. Select the System Type for the account:
      * **Classic**: Codefresh pipelines only.
      * **GitOps**: GitOps applications integrated with ArgoCD.
      * **Project One**: The New Codefresh Experience with Classic Pipelines and GitOps as a single module with a unified sidebar menu and shared administration and configuration. 
      * **GitOps + Classic**: Available as two different modules, with one of them active at any one time. You can toggle between the modules.
  1. Click **Save**.

{:start="6"}
1. Set the number of **Runtime Environments** for this account.
1. Set the number of **Parallel Builds**.
1. In the **Collaborators** column, click the **Edit** icon and increase the count to equal the number of users you plan on inviting to the account, and then click the **Save** icon. 
  You can always change this later.
1. If you have a Windows environment, set the number of **Nodes**.
1. To enable username-password login for the users in this account, set **User/Pass Enabled** to **ON**.
1. To disable users in this account from creating personal accounts after signing in to Codefresh, set **Disable Personal Account** to **ON**.
1. For Windows environments, set the **Codefresh Env** to use.
1. Continue with [Step 3: Invite a user to a Codefresh account](#step-3-invite-a-user-to-a-codefresh-account).

### Step 3: Invite a user to a Codefresh account

Invite one or more to the Codefresh account you created.  
The maximum number of users you can invite to your account depends on the number of Collaborators defined for the account. A Collaborator is a Codefresh user who can access the UI and perform different actions.
Once users are invited, their statuses remain as Pending until they accept the invitations.



1. From the account's context menu, select **Invite user into account**.

 {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/user-invite-to-account.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/user-invite-to-account.png"
  alt="Invite user to Codefresh account"
  caption="Invite user to Codefresh account"
  max-width="60%"
    %} 

{:start="2"}
1. Enter the user's email address and click **Add**.

  {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/invite-user-to-account.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/invite-user-to-account.png"
  alt="Sending the invite to the user"
  caption="Sending the invite to the user"
  max-width="60%"
    %} 

  The Users list displays the predefined `codefresh-system` and the `AdminCF` users, and the user you invited. 
  * The username is automatically generated by Codefresh.
  * The Email column shows the email address.
  * The Status column shows Pending. 

 {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/users-page-with-new-user.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/users-page-with-new-user.png"
  alt="Newly invited user with Pending status"
  caption="Newly invited user with Pending status"
  max-width="60%"
    %}

{:start="3"}
1. Optional. To enable username-password login for the user, complete these additional steps:
    1. Click the icon to the left of the username, and select **Show Invite Link**.
    1. Copy the link from the popup that appears and click **OK**.
    1. Send the link to the user, requesting the user to sign in to Codefresh with the link for the first time.
1. Continue with [Step 4: Enable features for the account](#step-4-enable-features-for-the-account).




### Step 4: Enable features for the account 
Enable features to open them for Codefresh accounts in your organization.  
This step describes how to enable features for a single account at a time.

>**NOTE**  
To enable features selectively for specific accounts, or for all accounts in the organization, see [Codefresh on-premises feature management]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/on-premises/on-prem-feature-management/).



#### Enable/disable features for a specific account

**Before you begin**  
* Review [feature descriptions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/on-premises/on-prem-feature-management/#on-premises-feature-list)

**How to**  

1. Make sure you are in **Admin Management**.
1. From the sidebar, select **Accounts**.
1. To filter the feature list, from the **All** dropdown list, select the category you want to see. 

 {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/enable-features-for-account-accounts.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/enable-features-for-account-accounts.png"
  alt="Enable features for a specific Codefresh account"
  caption="Enable features for a specific Codefresh account"
  max-width="60%"
    %}

{:start="4"}
1. To enable a feature for the account, below **Enable**, toggle the required feature to **ON**. 



#### Enable System Features  
System Features are generally for internal use. 
For convenience and ease of set up, _turn on ONLY the System Features listed in this section_.   
When you enable System Features, the behavior for a specific System Feature is identical to that of the other Feature Flags: you can enable/disable it for a single, for specific, or for all accounts.

{{site.data.callout.callout_warning}}
**IMPORTANT**   
Codefresh _strongly recommends against enabling the System Features not explicitly mentioned here_, unless you are familiar with the implications of turning on each of the features.  
If you need to turn on a feature, we recommend to first contact Codefresh support. 
{{site.data.callout.end}}

1. Make sure you are in **Admin Management**.
1. From the sidebar, click **Feature Management**. 
1. Toggle **System Features** on the top right to **ON**.
1. In the Search Features field, search for the following features in turn, and then toggle **Enabled** to **ON** for each of them:
  * `ssoManagement`: Enables user login with SSO provider integrations set up in Codefresh.
  * `teamsManagement`: Enables the account administrator to create teams, and assign users in an account to one or more teams.
  * `emailDomainManagement`: Enables restricting user invitations to the domains defined.

 {% include image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/enable-system-features.png"
  url="/images/installation/on-prem-setup/enable-system-features.png"
  alt="Enable system features for a Codefresh account"
  caption="Enable system features for a Codefresh account"
  max-width="60%"
    %}




You have now created a Codefresh account, added one or more users the account, and enabled or disabled features for the account.
Review **What to do next** for tips on how to proceed.


    

   
### What to do next
* Set the [options]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/login-options/) to display in the Sign-In page
* Depending on the System Type activated, you are now ready to create:
  * [Projects and pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/pipelines/)  
  * Pipeline integrations for [Git providers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/git-providers/), [Docker registries]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/) and more
  * [GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/image-enrichment-overview/) integrations for image enrichment
  * [GitOps applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application)

See our quick starts for [CI/CD]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/ci-quick-start/) and [GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/gitops-quick-start/).
