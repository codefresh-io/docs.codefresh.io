In GitOps-driven promotions with Codefresh, environments, products, and applications are the foundational entities that enable seamless deployment and lifecycle management.

* **Environments** represent the various stages in your software delivery process, such as testing, staging, or production. Each environment serves a specific purpose, ensuring visibility into applications as they progress through development before reaching production.  
For details, see [Environments dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/gitops-environments/).

* **Products** bridge the gap between environments and applications. By grouping and managing applications as cohesive units, products simplify coordination, enhance organization, and amplify your ability to manage complex deployments.  
For details, see [About Products]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/about-products/).

* **Applications** are the core building blocks of your software delivery process. They represent the deployable artifacts, services, or microservices that power your business. Managing applications effectively is essential for ensuring reliability and efficiency in production.  
For details, see [Creating Argo CD applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/).
