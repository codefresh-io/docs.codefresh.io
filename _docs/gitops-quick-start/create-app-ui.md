## Applications quick start
In this quick start we'll create applications â€” the fundamental building blocks of software delivery.  
Applications are Argo CD applications that represent Kubernetes resources deployed and managed through GitOps principles. 

Applications and products, together with environments we created in the previous quick start, complete the core entities needed for GitOps promotions.

We'll do the following:
* Create three applications
* Create a product for the applications
* View the Environments dashboard populated with applications
* Explore the Product Dashboard

For detailed information, see [About Argo CD applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/).


## Products in GitOps

Products are one of the three core entities for promotions in Codefresh GitOps, bridging the gap between environments and applications. They also amplify the capabilities of applications by grouping and managing them as cohesive units.

%} 

For detailed information, see [Products]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/about-products/).

##### Why create Products?

Here are a few reasons why you would want to create products to manage your applications.

* **Bridging applications and environments**: By grouping related applications within a product, you ensure visibility and control over their deployment paths, keeping all components in sync as they move through environments together. Products reflect how developers perceive applications (such as microservices)- not as separate entities across environments, but as a single entity with minor configuration differences.


* **Unified application promotion and deployment**: Managing multiple individual Argo CD applications across various environments can be complex. Products streamline this process by grouping related applications, enabling more efficient and cohesive management and promotion.

## Example Git repo
To replicate the setup, use the example GitHub repository containing the [application configuration manifests](https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo/tree/main/argocd-app-manifests){:target="_blank"}. These manifests are preconfigured to help you deploy the applications easily to their respective environments.

### Demo applications folder
The [demo-applications folder](https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo/tree/main/demo-applications){:target="_blank"} in the same repository provides preconfigured Helm charts for creating the applications. Each subfolder corresponds to a specific application and includes:
* `Chart.yaml`: Defines the application version (`appVersion`) and dependencies.
* `values.yaml`: Contains environment-specific configurations.
* Other Helm files: Provide a complete Helm chart structure for deploying the application.

### How to use the files
When you create the application, to use the resources, select the folder corresponding to the target environment. For example, `trioapp-dev` for development.

## Requirements
* [GitOps Runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/gitops-quick-start/runtime/)
* [Git Source]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/create-git-source/) to store application manifests
* [Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/products/quick-start-gitops-environments/)  
  At least three environments for the different applications representing the basic stages in the SDLC



## Create your first application
Create the first application to correspond to the version of the application you want in the development environment.  
For the quick start, we'll do the following:
* Create the `demo-trioapp-dev` application
* Create a Product for this application, the `demo-triopapp` product
* Configure other required application configuration settings
* Commit the application to a Git Source

### Step-by-step
1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **GitOps Apps**.
1. Click **Add Application** on the top-right.
1. In the Add Application panel, add definitions for the application:
  * **Application name**: `demo-trioapp-dev` for our first application.  
    We added `-dev` to the application name to differentiate it from the other `demo-trioapp` applications we'll create.
  * **Runtime**: The GitOps Runtime you installed to associate with the application, `demo-runtime` for the quick start.  
  * **Name for YAML file**: The name of the application's configuration manifest, assigned on commit to Git. By default, the manifest is assigned the application name.  
    You can click the Edit icon and change the name if you want to.

  >**NOTE**  
  You cannot change the application definitions once you continue to the Configuration settings.

   alt="Applications quick start: Application definitions" 
   caption="Applications quick start: Application definitions"
   max-width="50%" 
   %} 

{:start="4"}
1. Click **Next** to go to the Configuration tab. 
  By default you are in Form mode. You can toggle between Form and YAML modes as you define the application's configuration settings.
1. In the **General** settings for the application, first create a new product for the application: 
  * Click the **Product** dropdown, and then click **Add Product**. 
  * Type the name of the product, for example, `demo-trioapp`.  
    The product is tagged with the label New, and the application is automatically assigned to the product.

   alt="Applications quick start: Configuration > General: Product settings" 
   caption="Applications quick start: Configuration > General: Product settings"
   max-width="70%" 
   %}  

{:start="6"}
1. Define the other required **General** settings for the application:
  * **Repository URL**: The URL to the repo in Git where you created the YAML resource files for the application.  
    For the example Git repo, this is the repository URL is [https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo](https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo){:target="\_blank"}
  * **Revision**: The branch in Git with the resource files. For example, `main`.
  * **Path**: The folder in the Git repository with the resource files for the application.  
    In the follow along Git repo, if you are creating the development version of the application, the path should point to the resource files in `demo-applications/trioapp-dev` in [example repo](https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo/tree/main/demo-applications){:target="\_blank"}
  * **Namespace**: Define a namespace in the environment where you are creating the application. For example, `demo-dev`. 
  * **Auto-create namespace**: If you defined a namespace which doesn't already, select this option to ensure that the namespace is automatically created. 
  * **Sync Policy**:  
    Change to **Automatic** if needed.  
    Select **Prune resources** to automatically remove unused resources.  
    Select **Self-heal** to always enforces a sync to the desired state in Git, if and when there is a change to the actual state in the cluster.

   %} 


{:start="7"}
1. Retain the default **Advanced Settings**.  
  The only setting to note here is that we are creating a Helm application.
1. To commit all changes, select **Commit**.  
  The Commit form is displayed with the application's definitions on the left, and the read-only version of the manifest with the configuration settings you defined on the right.
1. Select the **Git Source** you added to the Runtime, which is the Git repository to which to commit the application's manifest.     
  For example, the Git Source which we created earlier, the `demo-trio-gitsource`.

   %} 

{:start="10"} 
1. Add a commit message and then click **Commit** at the bottom-right of the panel.  
  * A summary screen is displayed for the new product, `demo-trioapp`, including the annotation that links the application to the product.
  * Clicking **Explore Product** takes you to the Product Dashboard.  
    We'll create the testing and production versions of the application, and then explore the Product Dashboard.

   caption="Applications quick start: New product summar"
   max-width="40%" 
   %} 

{:start="11"} 
1. View the new application in the GitOps Apps dashboard.  
  You may have to wait for a few seconds until the application is synced to the cluster for it to be displayed in the dashboard.

   max-width="60%" 
   %} 
  
{:start="12"} 
1. Continue with [Create additional applications](#create-additional-applications).

### YAML manifest for development version of application
Here's an example of the YAML manifest generated for the `demo-trioapp-dev` application.
 

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: demo-trioapp-dev
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io/foreground
  annotations:
    codefresh.io/product: demo-trioapp
spec:
  project: default
  destination:
    name: in-cluster
    namespace: demo-dev
  source:
    path: demo-applications/trioapp-dev
    repoURL: https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo.git
    targetRevision: main
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
      allowEmpty: false
    syncOptions:
      - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground
      - Replace=false
      - PruneLast=false
      - Validate=true
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=false
      - ServerSideApply=true
      - RespectIgnoreDifferences=false
```
## Create additional applications
Follow the steps in [Create your first application](#create-your-first-application) to create two more applications, representing the testing and production versions in the application lifecyle.  
Remember to also select the same product for each application as you create it. 

##### Important
When creating the two additional applications, make sure to update the following settings accordingly:
* **Path**: The folder in the Git repository with the resource files for the application.  
  In the example Git repo, for the testing and production versions of the application, the path should point to the application's resource files in `demo-applications/trioapp-qa` and `demo-applications/trioapp-prod` folders in [demo-applications](https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo/tree/main/demo-applications){:target="\_blank"}
* **Namespace**: Define different namespaces in the different environments where you are creating the applications. For example, `demo-qa` and `demo-prod`. 

Here's a view of the GitOps Apps dashboard with all the three applications linked to their Git Source.

### YAML manifest for testing version of application
Here's an example of the YAML manifest generated for the `demo-trioapp-qa` application.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: demo-trioapp-qa
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io/foreground
  annotations:
    codefresh.io/product: demo-trioapp
spec:
  project: default
  destination:
    name: in-cluster
    namespace: demo-qa
  source:
    path: demo-applications/trioapp-qa
    repoURL: https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo.git
    targetRevision: main
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
      allowEmpty: false
    syncOptions:
      - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground
      - Replace=false
      - PruneLast=false
      - Validate=true
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=false
      - ServerSideApply=true
      - RespectIgnoreDifferences=false   
```


### YAML manifest for production version of application
Here's an example of the YAML manifest generated for the `demo-trioapp-prod` application.

```yaml
apiVersion: argoproj.io/v1alpha1
kind: Application
metadata:
  name: demo-trioapp-prod
  finalizers:
    - resources-finalizer.argocd.argoproj.io/foreground
  annotations:
    codefresh.io/product: demo-trioapp
spec:
  project: default
  destination:
    name: in-cluster
    namespace: demo-prod
  source:
    path: demo-applications/trioapp-prod
    repoURL: https://github.com/codefresh-sandbox/codefresh-quickstart-demo.git
    targetRevision: main
  syncPolicy:
    automated:
      prune: true
      selfHeal: true
      allowEmpty: false
    syncOptions:
      - PrunePropagationPolicy=foreground
      - Replace=false
      - PruneLast=false
      - Validate=true
      - CreateNamespace=true
      - ApplyOutOfSyncOnly=false
      - ServerSideApply=true
      - RespectIgnoreDifferences=false
```
## View changes in Environments dashboard

Return to the Environments dashboard to see how the environments are populated with the applications you created.
 
* From the sidebar, select **Environments**.
  Each environment displays the product you created. For example, `demo-trioapp`.
* Mouse over the product name in each environment to see the associated applications. For example, `demo-trioapp-dev`, `demo-trioapp-qa`, and `demo-trioapp-prod`.

  {% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/quick-start/environments-products/env-with-assigned-apps.png" 
   url="/images/quick-start/environments-products/env-with-assigned-apps.png" 
   alt="Applications quick start: Environments with products and applications" 
   caption="Applications quick start: Environments with products and applications"
   max-width="70%" 
   %} 

## Explore the Product Dashboard

Now that we have created the three applications for the `demo-trioapp` product, let's explore the Product Dashboard for the same. 

The Product Dashboard provides a centralized view of your product's applications across environments, including release versions, dependencies, and insights from Kubernetes, Git, and issue-tracking tools. 

* From the sidebar, select **Products**, and then click the name of the product. For example `demo-trioapp`.
  Here's an example of the Product Dashboard for `demo-trioapp` with the applications we created for the quick start.

{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/quick-start/environments-products/product-dashboard-view.png" 
	url="/images/quick-start/environments-products/product-dashboard-view.png" 
	alt="Applications quick start: Product Dashboard with product's applications" 
	caption="Applications quick start: Product Dashboard with product's applications"
  max-width="60%" 
%}

##### Key features to focus on

* **Release versions**: Quickly identify which version of an application is deployed in each environment to maintain consistency or troubleshoot issues. For detailed information, see [Configuring app version for promotions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/promotion-version-properties/#configuring-versions-for-promoted-applications).
* **Dependency insights**: Compare dependency versions across environments to detect inconsistencies or verify production readiness.
* **Integrated application insights**: Use Git commit history, Kubernetes data, and feature mappings to evaluate changes, troubleshoot, and plan promotions.  
  Requirement: Integrate CI platforms/tools  
  For the Git and Features tabs to work seamlessly, ensure your CI/CD systems are integrated.  
  If you have CI platforms/tools already in place, be it Codefresh pipelines, GitHub Actions, or Jenkins, you can integrate them with Codefresh GitOps. The same applies to issue-tracking tools like Jira.  
  For setup instructions, see [Image enrichments with GitOps integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/image-enrichment-overview/).

 
## What's next?
We'll dive into how to promote changes and deploy applications across environments using the entities you've created and worked with: Environments, products, and applications.  

Let's move on to the first quick start on promotions to see this in action.
