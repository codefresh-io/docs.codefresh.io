Products not only bridge the gap between environments and applications but also amplify the capabilities of your applications by grouping and managing them as cohesive units.

Here are a few reasons why you would want to create products to manage your applications.



* **Bridging applications and environments**  
  Products create a vital link between applications and their environments. By grouping applications within a product, you gain visibility and control over their deployment paths, ensuring all components move through environments together.


* **Unified application promotion and deployment**  
  Managing individual Argo CD applications across multiple environments can become complex. Products simplify this by grouping related applications, enabling efficient, cohesive management and promotion.


* **Effortless creation**  
  Creating a product is as simple as creating an environment. You can do so directly from the UI, declaratively by annotating application manifests, or even when creating applications themselves.
