We’ve already created two of the three core entities essential for GitOps promotions: Environments and applications.

Now, it’s time to create the third core entity: Products. Products not only bridge the gap between environments and applications but also amplify the capabilities of your applications by grouping and managing them as cohesive units.

Before we dive into the how, let's briefly look at the !



## What do you get from Products?

* **Bridging applications and environments**  
  Products create a vital link between applications and their environments. By grouping applications within a product, you gain visibility and control over their deployment paths, ensuring all components move through environments together.


* **Unified application promotion and deployment**  
  Managing individual Argo CD applications across multiple environments can become complex. Products simplify this by grouping related applications, enabling efficient, cohesive management and promotion.


* **Effortless creation**  
  Creating a product is as simple as creating an environment. You can do so directly from the UI, declaratively by annotating application manifests, or even when creating applications themselves.
