In the previous quick start we [created environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/products/quick-start-gitops-environments/),  one of the three core entities essential for GitOps promotions. Now, itâ€™s time to create another core entity: Products. 

Products not only bridge the gap between environments and applications but also amplify the capabilities of your applications by grouping and managing them as cohesive units.

## Why create products?

Here are a few reasons why you would want to create products to manage your applications.



* **Bridging applications and environments**  
  Products create a vital link between applications and their environments. By grouping applications within a product, you gain visibility and control over their deployment paths, ensuring all components move through environments together.


* **Unified application promotion and deployment**  
  Managing individual Argo CD applications across multiple environments can become complex. Products simplify this by grouping related applications, enabling efficient, cohesive management and promotion.


* **Effortless creation**  
  Creating a product is as simple as creating an environment. You can do so directly from the UI, declaratively by annotating application manifests, or even when creating applications themselves.



## Create your first product
A product requires a unique name, and an annotation through which to connect the different applications.

##### Before you begin
* Make sure you have at least [one environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/products/quick-start-gitops-environments/)  


##### Step-by-step

1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Products**.
1. Click **Add Product**.
1. Define the following:
    1. **Name**: A unique name for the Product, `demo-trioapp` for the quick start.
    1. **Connect Applications**: Displays the annotation associated with this product that is automatically created, and used to connect the different applications to it. In our case, `codefresh.io/product: demo-trioapp`. 
    1. **Tags**: Leave this empty for the quick start.

	alt="Products quick start: Create product" 
	caption="Products quick start: Create product"
  max-width="50%" 
%}

{:start="4"}
1. Click **Add**.  
   The Product is displayed in the Products page. 
1. Click the product name to see the dashboard for the individual product.  
   You'll notice that the product currently has no applications assigned to it.

## What's next
After creating two of the three core entities for GitOps promotions, environments and products, we are ready to dive into applications.
