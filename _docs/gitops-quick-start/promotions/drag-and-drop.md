In this first quick start on promotions, we'll see how to promote products using the intuitive drag-and-drop functionality in the Environments dashboard. 

This quick, visual method allows you to manually move applications between two environments in just a few steps.

Use this method when you want to:
* Quickly test changes in a different environment
* Manually promote a product version for validation or further deployment

## Before you begin
If you haven't done so already, create:
* [Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/products/quick-start-gitops-environments/)  
* [Products]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/products/quick-start-product-create/)  
* [Applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/products/create-app-ui/)  

## Promote product applications through drag-and-drop

1. From the sidebar, select **Environments**.  
    * The `demo-trioapp` product is displayed in the `dev`, `qa`, and `prod` environments. 
    * Note the release versions for the product in each environment.  
      For example, the version in `dev` is different from those in `qa` and `prod`, indicating changes to the application that have not yet been deployed to all environments.

1. To view the applications linked to the product `demo-trioapp` in each environment, mouse over the product name in each of the environments.

{:start="3"}
1. Drag and drop the application into the desired target environment.  
  For the quick start, we'll promote `demo-trioapp` by dragging `demo-trioapp-dev` from `dev` and dropping it into `demo-trioapp` in the `qa` environment.

{:start="4"}
1. Click **Commit** to commit the changes.  
  The Commit Changes page displays details about the promotion, including the action used, the files impacted, and the properties being updated.

1. Review the changes carefully and click **Promote**. 
1. Continue with [View release created for product](#view-release-created-for-product).


## View release created for product
After committing the changes, the promotion mechanism automatically creates a release for the product, `demo-trioapp` in our case.
Here you can monitor how the promotion is orchestrated between the environments `dev` and `qa`.

* Click **View Release Details** to go to the release view and monitor the release as it progresses between the `dev` and `qa` environments.

max-width="60%"

When the release completes execution, go to **Product > Releases** to see the information and status for the release.

## What's next
Now that you've learned how to promote a product using the drag-and-drop method, we'll explore more advanced promotion scenarios.  
The next quick start demonstrates how to orchestrate a multi-environment promotion through a Promotion Flow, enabling you to automate and streamline deployments across more than two environments.
