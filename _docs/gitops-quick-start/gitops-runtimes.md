If you have created your account, you can install the GitOps Runtime.

The GitOps Runtime is the cornerstone of Codefreshâ€™s GitOps capabilities, simplifying the complexity of managing deployments at scale with Argo CD. It provides unique benefits that enhance visibility, scalability, and security, making deployment management seamless and efficient. 



## Benefits of GitOps Runtimes

* **Unified visibility**  
  All Argo CD instances are managed through a single control plane, providing comprehensive visibility into all installed Runtimes. The GitOps Runtimes page displays essential details about each Runtime and offers tools for streamlined management.

* E**ffortless maintenance**  
  Easily track and upgrade Runtime versions. The Runtimes page includes a version column that alerts you when updates are available, with links to detailed changelogs for transparent decision-making.

* **Flexible scalability**  
  Simplify the management of multiple Argo CD instances by installing additional instances, or scale down by connecting extra remote clusters to an existing GitOps Runtime.
