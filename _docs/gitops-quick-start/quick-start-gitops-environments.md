## Environments quick start
In this quick start, we'll create different environments that map to the typical stages of the software development lifecycle (SDLC), and will help in promoting changes in your applications. 

We'll do the following:
* Create three different environments, `dev`, `qa`, and `prod`.
* Map them to a cluster, typically the one where the GitOps Runtime is installed. 
* Define namespaces within the cluster for each environment, ensuring clear separation between development, testing, and production.

##### Why create environments? 

Environments are key to managing and promoting applications effectively.  
They give you a structured, intuitive way to answer the question: _What’s running where?_

Environments help you:
* **Mirror your SDLC**: Align applications with their development stages, providing clarity and structure.
* **Simplify promotions**: Easily move applications through stages, ensuring consistency.

For detailed information, see [Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/gitops-environments/).

## Create an environment
Let's go ahead and create an environment. Setting up environments is as simple as mapping the environment to one or more clusters and namespaces.

For this quick start, we’ll create three environments: `dev`, `qa`, and `prod` on the cluster where you installed the GitOps Runtime.
We’ll map the environments to `in-cluster` and associate each with a different namespace, to which we will deploy the applications we’ll create later.

##### Step-by-step
1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Environments**, and then click **Add Environment**.
1. Define the following:
    1. **Name**: A unique name for your environment, which is meaningful in the context of your development and deployment cycle. 
	  For the first environment, we'll use `dev`.
    1. **Kind**: The purpose of the environment. Select **Non-production** where typically development, testing, and staging versions of applications are deployed.  
	  The Kind property is used to also define rules for promotions and ABAC (Attribute Based Access Control) permissions.
    1. **Tags**: Leave this empty for the quick start.
    1. **Clusters and Namespaces**: Map the environment to the cluster with the GitOps Runtime.  
        For the quick start, we'll map the environment to the `in-cluster`, and the `demo-dev` namespace. The namespace is associated with the `dev` environment, and the `demo` applications we'll add later on.

{:start="3"}  
1. Click **Add**.  
  The environment is displayed in the Environments dashboard. 
1. Repeat _step 1_ through _step 3_ to create the two other environments: `qa` and `prod`.  
  For the quick start, we'll map these environments again to the `in-cluster`. And to the namespaces, `demo-qa` and `demo-prod` respectively, for the `demo` apps we'll create. 

Here's an example of the Environments dashboard with the three environments.
The environments are automatically populated with the applications in the clusters and namespaces mapped to them.  
At this point, as we haven't created any applications, all environments are empty.

## What's next
You’re probably eager to dive into applications, and that's what we'll do in the next quick start.
