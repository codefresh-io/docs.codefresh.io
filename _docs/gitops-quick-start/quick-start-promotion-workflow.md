## Simple Promotion Workflow quick start
In this quick start guide, we'll guide you through creating a Promotion Workflow in Codefresh.  

Promotion Workflows are Argo WorkflowTemplates that allow you to automate tasks such as notifications, validations, or additional deployments during the promotion process. They can be used in Promotion Flows to automate tasks before or after promotion.
For detailed information, see [Configure Promotion Workflows]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/promotion-workflow/). 

In this example, you'll create a simple Promotion Workflow that sends a Slack notification when a promotion starts.  
The Workflow runs a container from Codefreshâ€™s Argo Hub, which posts a message to Slack.




## Requirements
* [GitOps Runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/runtime/)
* [Git Source]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/create-git-source/) to store application manifests.
* [Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/quick-start-gitops-environments/)
* [Shared Configuration Repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/shared-configuration)
  this is where you promotion workflow will be stored (in the `resources/control-planes/promotion-workflows` folder)

## Example 1: Create Promotion Workflow for Slack notifications

Creating a Promotion Workflow is as simple as creating an [Argo WorkflowTemplate](https://argo-workflows.readthedocs.io/en/latest/workflow-templates/){:target="\_blank"}.
You can do so directly from the UI.

For simplification, we are using a hard coded version of an existing template from [our library](https://github.com/codefresh-io/argo-hub/tree/main/workflows/slack/versions/0.0.2){:target="\_blank"}.

##### Step-by-step

1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Promotion Workflows**, and click **Add Promotion Workflow**.
1. Define the following:
    1. **Name**: A unique name for the Promotion Workflow, `slack-notification`
    for the quick start.
    1. **Description**: A meaningful comment on the purpose of the workflowTemplate, for example, `A template to send a Slack notification when a promotion start` in our case.
    1. **Resource Filename**: The name of the manifest file that will be saved in `resources/control-planes/promotion-workflows`
    folder in your Shared Configuration Repository. By default, this is identical to the Name of the Workflow. Leave as-is for the
    quick-start.

1. Click **Add**.
1. For the quick start, select **Blank Skeleton File** as the Workflow Template, and click **Next**.
1. In the YAML editor on the right, replace the `spec` in line 13 with the following block:
    ```yaml
    spec:
      serviceAccountName: promotion-template
      arguments:
        parameters:
          - name: APP_NAME
      entrypoint: slack-promotion
      templates:
        - name: slack-promotion
          container:
            name: main
            imagePullPolicy: Always
            image: quay.io/codefreshplugins/argo-hub-slack-post-to-channel:0.0.2-main
            command:
              - python
              - /slack/slack.py
            env:
              - name: SLACK_CHANNEL
                value: 'name@domain.com'
              - name: SLACK_MESSAGE
                value: 'Application `{{ workflow.parameters.APP_NAME }}` is ready to be promoted'
              - name: LOG_LEVEL
                value: 'info'
              - name: SLACK_TOKEN
                valueFrom:
                  secretKeyRef:
                    name: 'slack-token'
                    key: token          
    ```
  where:  
  * `SLACK_CHANNEL` can either be the name of a Slack channel or the email of a user.
  * `slack-token` is the name of the secret holding your Slack Token, in the `token` key.

1. Click **Commit**
1. Optional. Feel free to add a **Commit Message**.
1. Click **Commit** again.  
   After a few minutes, the new Promotion Workflow is displayed in the Promotion Workflows list.

	caption="Promotion workflow quick start: New promotion workflow"
 max-width="50%"

## Using Promotion Workflows
Once you create Promotion Workflows, you can use them in any Promotion Flow.
When you run your Promotion Flow using this Promotion Workflow, you should get a Slack message as in the example below.

	file="/images/quick-start/promotion-workflow/slack-message.png"
	url="/images/quick-start/promotion-workflow/slack-message.png"
	alt="Promotion workflow quick start: New slack message"
	caption="Promotion workflow quick start: New slack message"
 max-width="50%"
%}

## What's next
The next quick start will guide you through adding Promotion Workflows to each environment, acting as gates for conditional promotions, allowing you to introduce more control and flexibility in your promotion processes.
