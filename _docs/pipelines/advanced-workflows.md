Codefresh is very flexible when it comes to pipeline complexity and depth.  

You can easily create:
 * Sequential pipelines where step order is the same as the listing order in YAML (simple)
 * Sequential pipelines that have some parallel parts (intermediate)
 * Parallel pipelines where step order is explicitly defined (advanced)

With the parallel execution mode, you can define complex pipelines with fan-in/out configurations capable of matching even the most complicated workflows within an organization.

>In Codefresh, parallel execution is unrelated to [stages]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/stages/). Stages are only a way to visually organize your pipeline steps. The actual execution is independent from the visual layout in the logs view.

Before going any further make sure that you are familiar with the [basics of Codefresh pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/).

Codefresh offers two modes of execution:

1. Sequential mode (which is the default)
1. Parallel mode

## Sequential execution mode

The sequential mode is very easy to understand and visualize.

In sequential mode, the Codefresh execution engine starts from the first step defined at the top of the `codefresh.yml` file, and executes all steps one by one going down to the end of the file. A step is either executed or skipped according to its conditions.  

>The condition for each step is only examined **once**.

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
mode: sequential
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: sample-python-image
    working_directory: ./
    tag: ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running Unit tests
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    commands: 
      - python setup.py test
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here we have two steps, one that creates a Docker image and a second one that runs [unit tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/unit-tests/) inside it. The order of execution is identical to the order of the steps in the YAML file. This means that unit tests will always run after the Docker image creation.

Notice that the line `mode: sequential` is shown only for illustration purposes. Sequential mode is the default, and therefore this line can be omitted.

 
## Inserting parallel steps in a sequential pipeline

You don't have to activate parallel execution mode for the whole pipeline if only a part of it needs to run in parallel. Codefresh allows you insert a parallel phase inside a sequential pipeline with the following syntax:

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  my_task1:
    title: My Task 1
    [...] 
  my_parallel_tasks:
    type: parallel
    steps:
      my_task2a:
        title: My Task 2A
        [...]
      my_task2b:
        title: My Task 2B
        [...]
  my_task3:
    title: My Task3
    [...]  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


In this case tasks 2A and 2B will run in parallel. 
The step name that defines the parallel phase (`my_parallel_tasks` in the example above), is completely arbitrary. 

The final order of execution will be

1. Task 1
1. Task 2A and Task2B at the same time
1. Task 3

This is the recommended way to start using parallelism in your Codefresh pipelines. It is sufficient for most scenarios that require parallelism.

>**NOTE**:  
The names of the parallel steps must be unique within the same pipeline. The parent and child steps should NOT share the same name.

### Add timeouts for parallel steps
You can add `timeouts`for parallel steps either by defining a parent `timeout` inherited by the other parallel steps, or by defining individual timeouts for every step.  

>**NOTES**:  
The `timeout` field in the `deploy` and `pending-approval` steps has a specialized syntax and behavior to match the requirements of these steps.<br><br> 
When _both_ parent and step-specific timeouts are defined for parallel steps, the step-specific timeouts override the parent timeout.

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  parallel:
    type: parallel
    timeout: 1m
    steps:
      first:
        image: alpine
      second:
        image: alpine
        timeout: 2m 
      third:
        image: alpine
        timeout: null 
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Example: pushing multiple Docker images in parallel

Let's see an example where a Docker image is created and then we push it to more than one registry. This is a perfect candidate for parallelization. Here is the `codefresh.yml`:

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
- build
- push
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    stage: 'build'
    type: build
    image_name: trivialgoweb
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  PushingToRegistries:
    type: parallel
    stage: 'push'
    steps:
      jfrog_PushingTo_jfrog_BintrayRegistry:
        type: push
        title: jfrog_Pushing To Bintray Registry
        candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
        registry: bintray 
      PushingToGoogleRegistry:
        type: push
        title: Pushing To Google Registry
        candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
        registry: gcr
      PushingToDockerRegistry:
        type: push
        title: Pushing To Dockerhub Registry
        candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
        image_name: kkapelon/trivialgoweb
        registry: dockerhub  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The order of execution is the following:

1. MyAppDockerImage ([build step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/)) 
1. jfrog_PushingTo_jfrog_BintrayRegistry, PushingToGoogleRegistry, PushingToDockerRegistry ([push steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/push/))

The pipeline view for this yaml file is the following.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/parallel-push.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/parallel-push.png"
alt="Parallel Docker push" 
caption="Parallel Docker push"
max-width="80%"
%}

As you can see we have also marked the steps with [stages]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/stages/) so that we get a visualization that matches the execution.


### Example: Running multiple test suites in parallel

All types of steps can by placed inside a parallel phase. Another common use case would be the parallel execution of [freestyle steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/) for unit/integration tests.

Let's say that you have a Docker image with a Python back-end and a JavaScript front-end. You could run both types of tests in parallel with the following yaml syntax:

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-full-stack-app
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyTestingPhases:
    type: parallel
    steps:
      my_back_end_tests:
        title: Running Back end tests
        image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        commands: 
          - python setup.py test
      my_front_end_tests:
        title: Running Front End tests
        image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        commands: 
          - npm run test
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Running different types of tests (unit/integration/load/acceptance) in parallel is a very common use case for parallelism inside an otherwise sequential pipeline.

### Defining success criteria for a parallel step

By default, any failed step in a Codefresh pipeline will fail the whole pipeline. You can change the default execution behavior through the `fail_fast` field, but specifically for parallel steps you can define exactly when the whole step succeeds or fails.

You can define steps that will be used to decide if a parallel step succeeds with this syntax:

{% highlight yaml %}
second_step:
  title: Second step
  success_criteria:
    steps:
      only:
        - my_unit_tests
  type: parallel
    steps:
      my_unit_tests:
        title: Running Back end tests
        image: node
        commands: 
          - npm run test
      my_integration_tests:
        title: Running Integration tests
        image: node
        commands: 
          - npm run int-test
      my_acceptance_tests:
        title: Running Acceptance tests
        image: node
        commands: 
          - npm run acceptance-test    
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, if integration and/or acceptance tests fail, the whole pipeline will continue, because we have defined that only the results of unit test matter for the whole parallel step.

The reverse relationship (i.e., defining steps to be ignored) can be defined with the following syntax

{% highlight yaml %}
second_step:
  title: Second step
  success_criteria:
    steps:
      ignore:
        - my_integration_tests
        - my_acceptance_tests
  type: parallel
    steps:
      my_unit_tests:
        title: Running Back end tests
        image: node
        commands: 
          - npm run test
      my_integration_tests:
        title: Running Integration tests
        image: node
        commands: 
          - npm run int-test
      my_acceptance_tests:
        title: Running Acceptance tests
        image: node
        commands: 
          - npm run acceptance-test    
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above we have explicitly defined that even if the integration or acceptance tests fail the whole pipeline will continue.

### Shared Codefresh volume and race conditions

In any pipeline step, Codefresh automatically attaches a [shared volume]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/#sharing-the-workspace-between-build-steps) that is used to transfer artifacts between steps. The same volume is also shared between steps that run in parallel.


Here is an example where two parallel steps are writing two files. After they finish execution, we list the contents of the project folder.

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  WritingInParallel:
    type: parallel
    steps:
      writing_file_1:
        title: Step1A
        image: alpine
        commands: 
          - echo "Step1A" > first.txt
      writing_file_2:
        title: Step1B
        image: alpine
        commands: 
          - echo "Step1B" > second.txt
  MyListing:
    title: Listing of files
    image: alpine
    commands: 
          - ls    
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The results from the `MyListing` step is the following:

```
first.txt   second.txt  
```

This illustrates the side effects for both parallel steps that were executed on the same volume.

>It is therefore your responsibility to make sure that steps that run in parallel play nice with each other. Currently, Codefresh performs no conflict detection at all. If there are race conditions between your parallel steps, (e.g. multiple steps writing at the same files), the final behavior is undefined. It is best to start with a fully sequential pipeline, and use parallelism in a gradual manner if you are unsure about the side effects of your steps

## Implicit parallel steps
> If you use implicit parallel steps, you _cannot_ use _parallel pipeline mode_.

In all the previous examples, all parallel steps have been defined explicitly in a pipeline. This works well for a small number of steps, but in some cases it can be cumbersome to write such a pipeline, especially when the parallel steps are similar.

Codefresh offers two handy ways to lessen the amount of YAML you have to write and get automatic parallelization with minimum effort.

* The `scale` syntax allows you to quickly create parallel steps that are mostly similar (but still differ)
* The `matrix` syntax allows you to quickly create parallel steps for multiple combinations of properties 

###  Scale parallel steps (one dimension)

If you look back at the parallel docker push example you will see that all push steps are the same. The only thing that changes is the registry that they push to.

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
- build
- push
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    stage: 'build'
    type: build
    image_name: trivialgoweb
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  PushingToRegistries:
    type: parallel
    stage: 'push'
    steps:
      jfrog_PushingTo_jfrog_BintrayRegistry:
        type: push
        title: jfrog_Pushing To Bintray Registry
        candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
        registry: bintray 
      PushingToGoogleRegistry:
        type: push
        title: Pushing To Google Registry
        candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
        registry: gcr
      PushingToDockerRegistry:
        type: push
        title: Pushing To Dockerhub Registry
        candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
        image_name: kkapelon/trivialgoweb
        registry: dockerhub  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


This pipeline can be simplified by using the special `scale` syntax to create a common parent step with all similarities:


`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
- build
- push
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    stage: 'build'
    type: build
    image_name: trivialgoweb
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  PushingToRegistries:
    stage: 'push'
    type: push
    tag: '${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
    candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    scale:
      jfrog_PushingTo_jfrog_BintrayRegistry:
        registry: bintray 
      PushingToGoogleRegistry:
        registry: gcr
      PushingToDockerRegistry:
        image_name: kkapelon/trivialgoweb
        registry: dockerhub  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can see now that all common properties are defined once in the parent step (`PushingToRegistries`) while each push step only contains what differs. Codefresh will automatically create parallel steps when it encounters the `scale` syntax.

The resulting pipeline is more concise but runs in the same manner as the original YAML. For a big number of parallel steps, the `scale` syntax is very helpful for making the pipeline definition more clear.

You can use the `scale` syntax with all kinds of steps in Codefresh and not just push steps. Another classic example would be running tests in parallel with different environment variables. 


`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  run_tests_in_parallel:
    stage: 'Microservice A'
    working_directory: './my-front-end-code'
    image: node:latest
    commands:
     - npm run test
    scale:
      first:       
        environment:
          - TEST_NODE=0        
      second:
        environment:
          - TEST_NODE=1
      third:
        environment:
          - TEST_NODE=2
      fourth:
        environment:
          - TEST_NODE=3          
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline will automatically create 4 parallel freestyle steps. All of them will use the same Docker image and executed the same command (`npm run test`) but each one will receive a different value for the environment variable called `TEST_NODE`. 

Notice that if you define environment variables on the parent step (`run_tests_in_parallel` in the example above), they will also be available on the children parallel steps. And if those define, environment variables as well, all environment variables will be available.


### Matrix parallel steps (multiple dimensions)

The `scale` syntax allows you to easily create multiple parallel steps that differ only in a single dimension. If you have multiple dimensions of properties that differ and you want to run all possible combinations (Cartesian product) then the `matrix` syntax will do that for you automatically.

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - prepare
  - test
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    repo: 'codefreshdemo/cf-example-unit-test'
    revision: 'master'
    git: github
    stage: prepare
  run_my_tests_before_build:
    stage: test
    working_directory: './golang-app-A'
    commands:
     - go test -v
    matrix:
      image:
        - golang:1.11
        - golang:1.12
        - golang:1.13
      environment:
        - [CGO_ENABLED=1]
        - [CGO_ENABLED=0]         
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here we want run unit tests with 3 different versions of GO and also try with CGO enabled or not. Instead of manually writing 6 parallel steps in your pipeline with all possible combinations, we can simply use the `matrix` syntax to create the following parallel steps:

* Go 1.11 with CGO enabled
* Go 1.11 with CGO disabled
* Go 1.12 with CGO enabled
* Go 1.12 with CGO disabled
* Go 1.13 with CGO enabled
* Go 1.13 with CGO disabled

The resulting Codefresh YAML is much more compact. Notice that because the `environment` property in Codefresh is already an array on its own, when we use it with the `matrix` syntax we need to enclose its value with `[]` (array of arrays).

You can add more dimensions to a matrix build (and not just two as shown in the example). Here is another example with 3 dimensions:

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - prepare
  - test
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    stage: prepare
    type: git-clone
    repo: 'codefresh-contrib/spring-boot-2-sample-app'
    revision: master
    git: github
  MyUnitTests:
    stage: test
    matrix:
      image:
        - 'maven:3.5.2-jdk-8-alpine'
        - 'maven:3.6.2-jdk-11-slim'
        - 'maven:3-jdk-8'
      commands:
        - ["mvn --version", "mvn -Dmaven.repo.local=/codefresh/volume/m2_repository test"]
        - ["mvn --version", "mvn -Dmaven.test.skip -Dmaven.repo.local=/codefresh/volume/m2_repository package"]
      environment:
        - [MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms1024m]
        - [MAVEN_OPTS=-Xms512m]       
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline creates 3 x 2 x 2 = 12 parallel steps with all the possible combinations of:

* Maven version
* Running or disabling tests
* Using 1GB or 512MBs of memory.

Remember that all parallel steps run within the same pipeline executor so make sure that you have enough resources as the number
of matrix variations can quickly grow if you add too many dimensions.

Notice that, as with the `scale` syntax, the defined values/properties are merged between parent step (`MyUnitTests` in the example above) and children steps. For example, if you set an environment variable on the parent and also on child matrix steps , the result will a merged environment where all values are available.

## Parallel pipeline execution
>**NOTE**:  
If you use parallel execution mode for pipelines, you _cannot_ use _implicit parallel steps_.

To activate advanced parallel mode for the whole pipeline, you need to declare it explicitly at the root of the `codefresh.yml` file:

```
version: '1.0'
mode: parallel
steps:
[...]
```

In full parallel mode, the order of steps inside the `codefresh.yml` **does not** affect the order of execution at all. The Codefresh pipeline engine instead:

1. Evaluates all step-conditions *at the same* time
2. Executes those that have their requirements met
3. Starts over with the remaining steps
4. Stops when there are no more steps to evaluate

This means that in parallel mode the conditions of a step are evaluated **multiple times** as the Codefresh execution engine tries to find which steps it should run next. This implication is very important when you try to understand the order of step execution.

Notice also that in parallel mode, if you don't define any step conditions, Codefresh will try to run **all** steps at once, which is probably not what you want in most cases. 

With parallel mode you are expected to define the order of steps in the yaml file, and the Codefresh engine will create a *graph* of execution that satisfies your instructions. This means that writing the `codefresh.yml` file requires more effort on your part, but on the other hand allows you to define the step order in ways not possible with the sequential mode. You also need to define which steps should depend on the automatic cloning of the pipeline (which is special step named `main_clone`).

In the next sections we describe how you can define the steps dependencies in a parallel pipeline.

### Single step dependencies

At the most basic level, you can define that a step *depends on* the execution of another step. This dependency is very flexible as Codefresh allows you run a second step once:

1. The first step is finished with success
1. The first step is finished with failure
1. The first completes (regardless of exit) status

The syntax for this is the following post-condition:

{% highlight yaml %}
second_step:
  title: Second step
  when:
    steps:
     - name: first_step
       on:
         - success
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to run the second step only if the first one fails the syntax is:

{% highlight yaml %}
second_step:
  title: Second step
  when:
    steps:
     - name: first_step
       on:
         - failure
{% endhighlight %}

Finally, if you don't care about the completion status the syntax is:

{% highlight yaml %}
second_step:
  title: Second step
  when:
    steps:
     - name: first_step
       on:
         - finished
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that `success` is the default behavior so if you omit the last two lines (i.e., the `on:` part) the second step
will wait for the next step to run successfully.

>Also notice that the name `main_clone` is reserved for the automatic clone that takes place in the beginning of pipelines that are linked to a git repository. You need to define which steps depend on it (probably the start of your graph) so that `git checkout` happens before the other steps.

As an example, let's assume that you have the following steps in a pipeline:

1. A build step that creates a Docker image
1. A freestyle step that runs [unit tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/unit-tests/) inside the Docker image
1. A freestyle step that runs [integrations tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/integration-tests/) *After* the unit tests, even if they fail
1. A cleanup step that runs after unit tests if they fail

Here is the full pipeline. Notice the explicit dependency to the `main_clone` step that checks out the code.

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
mode: parallel
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-node-js-app
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    when:
      steps:
        - name: main_clone
          on:
            - success
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running unit tests
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    fail_fast: false
    commands: 
      - npm run test 
    when:
      steps:
       - name: MyAppDockerImage
         on:
           - success 
  MyIntegrationTests:
    title: Running integration tests
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    commands: 
      - npm run integration-test  
    when:
      steps:
       - name: MyUnitTests
         on:
           - finished
  MyCleanupPhase:
    title: Cleanup unit test results
    image: alpine
    commands: 
      - ./cleanup.sh 
    when:
      steps:
       - name: MyUnitTests
         on:
           - failure   
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you run the pipeline you will see that Codefresh automatically understands that `MyIntegrationTests` and `MyCleanupPhase` can run in parallel right after the unit tests finish.

Also notice the `fail_fast: false` line in the unit tests. 
By default, if *any* step fails in a pipeline, the whole pipeline is marked as a failure. With `fail_fast` set to `false` as in the example, we can allow the pipeline to continue and complete execution.


### Multiple step dependencies

A pipeline step can also depend on multiple other steps. 

The syntax is:

{% highlight yaml %}
third_step:
  title: Third step
  when:
    steps:
      all:
       - name: first_step
         on:
           - success
       - name: second_step
         on:
           - finished     
{% endhighlight %}

In this case, the third step will run only when BOTH first and second are finished (and first is actually a success)

*ALL* is the default behavior so it can be omitted if this is what you need. The example above
is example the same as below:

{% highlight yaml %}
third_step:
  title: Third step
  when:
    steps:
     - name: first_step
       on:
         - success
     - name: second_step
       on:
         - finished     
{% endhighlight %}

Codefresh also allows you to define *ANY* behavior in an explicit manner:

{% highlight yaml %}
third_step:
  title: Third step
  when:
    steps:
      any:
       - name: first_step
         on:
           - success
       - name: second_step
         on:
           - finished     
{% endhighlight %}

Here the third step will run when either the first one *OR* the second one have finished.

As an example let's assume this time that we have:

1. A build step that creates a docker image
1. Unit tests that will run when the docker image is ready
1. Integration tests that run either after unit tests or if the docker image is ready (contrived example)
1. A cleanup step that runs when both kinds of tests are finished

Here is the full pipeline

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
mode: parallel
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-node-js-app
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running unit tests
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    fail_fast: false
    commands: 
      - npm run test 
    when:
      steps:
       - name: MyAppDockerImage
         on:
           - success 
  MyIntegrationTests:
    title: Running integration tests
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    commands: 
      - npm run integration-test  
    when:
      steps:
        any:
         - name: MyUnitTests
           on:
             - finished
         - name: MyAppDockerImage
           on:
             - success
  MyCleanupPhase:
    title: Cleanup unit test results
    image: alpine
    commands: 
      - ./cleanup.sh 
    when:
      steps:
        all:
         - name: MyUnitTests
           on:
             - finished  
         - name: MyIntegrationTests
           on:
             - finished   
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In this case Codefresh will make sure that cleanup happens only when both unit and integration tests are finished. 


### Custom step dependencies

For maximum flexibility you can define a custom condition for a step.

It is hard to describe all possible cases, because Codefresh supports a [mini DSL]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/conditional-execution-of-steps/#condition-expression-syntax) for conditions. All examples mentioned in conditional execution are still valid in parallel pipelines.

For example, run this step only if a PR is opened against the production branch:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
my_step:
  title: My step
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          validateTargetBranch: '"${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}" == "production"'
          validatePRAction: '''${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_ACTION}}'' == ''opened'''
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Run this step only for the master branch and when the commit message does not include "skip ci":

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
my_step:
  title: My step
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          noSkipCiInCommitMessage: 'includes(lower("${{CF_COMMIT_MESSAGE}}"), "skip ci") == false'
          masterBranch: '"${{CF_BRANCH}}" == "master"'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can now add extra conditions regarding the completion state of specific steps. A global object called `steps` contains all steps by name along with a `result` property with the following possible completion states:

* Success
* Failure
* Skipped (only valid in sequential mode)
* Finished (regardless of status)
* Pending
* Running

Finished is a shorthand for `success` or `failure` or `skipped`. It is only valid when used in [step dependencies]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/advanced-workflows/#single-step-dependencies), and cannot be used in custom conditions.

You can mix and match completion states from any other step in your pipeline. Here are some examples:

{% highlight yaml %}
my_step:
  title: My step
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          myCondition: steps.MyUnitTests.result == 'failure' || steps.MyIntegrationTests.result == 'failure'
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight yaml %}
my_step:
  title: My step
    when:
      condition:
        any:
          myCondition: steps.MyLoadTesting.result == 'success'
          myOtherCondition: steps.MyCleanupStep.result == 'success'
{% endhighlight %}

You can also use conditions in the success criteria for a parallel step. Here is an example

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
- start
- tests
- cleanup
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    stage: 'start'
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-full-stack-app
    working_directory: ./01_sequential/
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyTestingPhases:
    type: parallel
    stage: 'tests'
    success_criteria:
      condition:
        all:
          myCondition: ${{steps.my_back_end_tests.result}} === 'success' && ${{steps.my_front_end_tests.result}} === 'success'
    steps:
      my_back_end_tests:
        title: Running Back end tests
        image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        commands: 
          - exit 1
      my_front_end_tests:
        title: Running Front End tests
        image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
        commands: 
          - echo "Second"
  MyCleanupPhase:
    stage: 'cleanup'
    title: Cleanup unit test results
    image: alpine
    commands: 
      - echo "Finished"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}         


## Handling error conditions in a pipeline

It is important to understand the capabilities offered by Codefresh when it comes to error handling. You have several options at different levels of granularity to select what constitutes a failure and what not.

By default, *any* failed step in a pipeline will abort the whole pipeline and mark it as failure.

**`fail_fast` with `strict_fail_fast`**  

You can use the f`lag `fail_fast: false`:
* In a specific step to ignore it if it fails and continue execution
* At the root level of the pipeline if you want to apply it to all steps

If a parallel step has `fail_fast: false` in its definition, adding `strict_fail_fast: true` does not change the Build status returned even if a child step fails. This is because the parallel step itself is considered successful regardless of errors in child steps.

Therefore, if you want your pipeline to keep running to completion regardless of errors, you can add the following:

```
version: '1.0'
fail_fast: false
steps:
[...]
```

You also have the capability to define special steps that will run when the whole pipeline has a special completion status. Codefresh offers a special object called `workflow` that represents the whole pipeline and allows you to evaluate its status in a step.

For example, you can have a cleanup step that will run only if the workflow fails (regardless of the actual step that created the error) with the following syntax:

{% highlight yaml %}
my_cleanup_step:
  title: My Pipeline Cleanup
  when:
    condition:
      all:
        myCondition: workflow.result == 'failure'
{% endhighlight %}

As another example we have a special step that will send an email if the pipeline succeeds or if load-tests fail:

{% highlight yaml %}
my_email_step:
  title: My Email step
  when:
    condition:
      any:
        myCondition: workflow.result == 'success'
        myTestCondition: steps.MyLoadTesting.result == 'failure'
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that both examples assume that `fail_fast: false` is at the root of the `codefresh.yaml` file.

The possible values for `workflow.result` are:

* `running`
* `terminated`
* `failure`
* `pending-approval`
* `success`
