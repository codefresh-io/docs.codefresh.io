Codefresh provides a set of predefined variables automatically in each build, that you can use to parameterize the way your pipeline works. You can also define your own variables. Some common examples of predefined variables include:

* `CF_BRANCH` is the Git branch that was used for this pipeline.
* `CF_REVISION` is the Git hash that was used for this pipeline.
* `CF_BUILD_URL` is the url of the pipeline build.

## Using Codefresh variables in your pipelines

There are two ways to use a Codefresh variable in your pipelines:

1. Expose as UNIX environment variables
   This is the default method, where all variables in all freestyle steps are exposed as UNIX environment variables: `$MY_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE`.
1. Directly in YAML properties
   Use variables can be used in YAML properties with the syntax {% raw %}`${{MY_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE}}`{% endraw %}.

> If you are unsure about which form you need to use, feel free to use {% raw %}`${{MY_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE}}`{% endraw %} everywhere. This is the Codefresh specific form and should function in all sections of `codefresh.yml`. 

**Example: Print out the branch as an environment variable**  
In this example, we use simple `echo` commands, but any program or script that reads environment variables can also read them in the same manner.

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
MyOwnStep:
  title: Variable example
  image: alpine
  commands: 
    - echo $CF_BUILD_ID 
    - echo $CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED 
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


**Example: Use directly in YAML properties**  

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
MyAppDockerImage:
  title: Building Docker Image
  type: build
  image_name: my-own-app
  tag: ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


**Example: Concatenating variables**

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
MyAppDockerImage:
  title: Building Docker Image
  type: build
  image_name: my-own-app
  tag: ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}-${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The concatenation above creates Docker images with tags such as:

```
master-df6a04c
develop-ba1cd68
feature-vb145dh
```

>NOTE:  
 > This syntax is specific to Codefresh, and is **only** available within the Codefresh YAML file itself. If you want to write scripts or programs that use the Codefresh variables, you need to make them aware of the environment variable form.


## System variables

System variables are automatically injected to any freestyle step as environment variables.

> It is important to understand that all Git related variables such `CF_BRANCH`, `CF_COMMIT_MESSAGE`, `CF_REVISION` etc. are coming directly from the Git provider you use and have the same limitations of that provider. For example GitLab is sending less information in pull request events than normal pushes, and Bitbucket sends only the short hash of a commit in pull request events. We suggest you read the documentation of your Git provider first to understand what information is available for every Git event

| Any variable specified in the pipeline settings   | For example, if you configure the pipeline settings with a variable named PORT, you can put the variable in your YAML build descriptor as {% raw %}`${{PORT}}`{% endraw %}.  |

## Context-related Variables
Context-related variables are created dynamically during the workflow execution and according to the used steps.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Variable                                          | Description   |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Working Directories**                           | For example, you can set the working directory of step `A` with a variable named after a previously executed step, step `B`. Therefore, setting step `A` with {% raw %}`working-directory:${{B}}`{% endraw %} means that step `A` executes in the same working directory as step `B`.                |
| **Images**                                        | You can set the candidate field of the push step with a variable named after a previously executed build step. Since the details of a created image are not necessarily known ahead of time, the variable can create an association to an optionally dynamic image name. Therefore, setting push step `A` with {% raw %}`candidate:${{B}}`{% endraw %} means that step `A` will push the image built by step `B`. Note that this capability works only for `candidate` and `image` fields in Codefresh steps.               |

A very common pattern in Codefresh pipelines, is to create a Docker image in one step, and then run a command on its container in the next step (e.g. run [unit tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/unit-tests/)):

`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-own-app
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running Unit tests
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    commands: 
      - ./my-unit-tests.sh
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above you can see the `MyAppDockerImage` variable that denotes a Docker image created dynamically within this single pipeline. In the second step we use it as a Docker context in order to run unit tests. See also the [unit testing example app]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/example-catalog/ci-examples/run-unit-tests/).

## Step variables

Every [step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/) in a Codefresh pipeline also exposes several built-in variables. You can access them via the global `steps` parent variable.

 * Each step  creates a variable based on the name of the step. You can then use the members of each variable for status conditions such as: `steps.MyUnitTests.result == 'error'` for a step called `MyUnitTests`.
  * To access variables that have a non-standard (i.e. only alphanumeric and _ characters) names, use the Variable() function.

### Step Member variables

Variables that are created by steps can have members. The members depend on the step type. For example if you have a build step named `myBuildStep` you can get the ID of the docker image that gets created with {% raw %}`echo ${{steps.myBuildStep.imageId}}`{% endraw %}

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Step Type              | Members      |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| All step types           | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>name</li><li>type</li><li>description</li><li>workingDirectory</li><li>result</li></ul>{:/}  
| [Freestyle]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/)        | -                                                                                                                                                                              |
| [Composition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/composition/)        | -                                                                                                                                                                              |

| [Git-clone]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/)       | {::nomarkdown}<ul><li>revision</li><li>repo</li></ul>{:/}                                                                                  |

## GitHub release variables

GitHub allows you to create [releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/){:target="\_blank"} for marking specific Git tags for general availability.

You can set a [trigger]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/triggers/git-triggers/) for GitHub releases. When a GitHub release happens, the following variables are also available:



{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Variable        | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_RELEASE_NAME}}`{% endraw %}     | GitHub release title   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_RELEASE_TAG}}`{% endraw %}      | Git tag version   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_RELEASE_ID}}`{% endraw %}       | Internal ID for this release   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_PRERELEASE_FLAG}}`{% endraw %}  | true if the release if marked as non-production ready, false if it is ready for production   |

## GitHub Pull Request variables

When a pull request is closed in GitHub, the following variables are also available

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Variable        | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_MERGED}}`{% endraw %}     | true if the pull request was merged to base branch    |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_HEAD_BRANCH}}`{% endraw %}      | the head branch of the PR (the branch that we want to merge to master)  |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_MERGED_COMMIT_SHA}}`{% endraw %}       | the commit SHA on the base branch after the pull request was merged (in most cases it will be master)   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_HEAD_COMMIT_SHA}}`{% endraw %}  | the commit SHA on the head branch (the branch that we want to push)  |

## User-defined variables

User variables can be defined at 6 levels:

1. Manually within a step using the [export](http://linuxcommand.org/lc3_man_pages/exporth.html){:target="\_blank"} command or in any **subsequent** step with the [cf_export](#using-cf_export-command) command
1. [Freestyle step definition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/#examples) (using the `environment` field)
1. Specific build Execution (after clicking the "Build" button open the "Build Variables" section, or use the [CLI]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/codefresh-api/#example---triggering-pipelines))
1. Pipeline Definition (under "Environment variables" section in the [pipeline view]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#creating-new-pipelines))
1. [Shared Configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/shared-configuration/) (defined under your account settings, and used using the "Import from shared configuration" button under the "Environment Variables" section in the pipeline view)
1. Variables defined on the Project level (Under the variables tab on any project view)

The options are listed in order of priority (from the most important to the least important), so in case of multiple variables defined at different locations with the same name, the order of overriding will be as listed here.

For example if a pipeline variable is defined both in project level and as an execution parameter of a specific build, then the final result will be the value defined as a build parameter and the project level variable will not take effect. 

## Exporting environment variables from a freestyle step

Steps defined within steps are scoped to the step they were created in (even if you used the `export` command). To use variables across steps, we provide a shared file through which you can import and export variables. 
There are two ways to add variables to the shared file:

* Using the `cf_export` command
* Writing directly to the file

### Exporting variables with `cf_export` 
Within every freestyle step, the `cf_export` command allows you to export variables across steps by writing to the shared variables file.  

> The variables exported through `cf_export` overrides those at the pipeline-level.

You can either:
- Explicitly state a VAR=VAL pair  
- State the name of an existing *exported* environment variable (like EXISTING_VAR).

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  freestyle-step-1:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      # Normal export will only work in a single step
      - export EXISTING_VAR=www.example.com

      # CF export will now work in all other subsequent steps
      - cf_export VAR1=alpine:latest VAR2=VALUE2 EXISTING_VAR

  freestyle-step-2:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling 2
    image: ${{VAR1}}
    commands:
      - echo $VAR2
      - echo http://$EXISTING_VAR/index.php
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

<br>

#### `cf_export` syntax 

`cf_export` has the same syntax as the [bash export command](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Environment.html){:target="\_blank"}.   
This means that when you use it you **don't** need any dollar signs for the variable that is created/assigned.

```
cf_export $MY_VAR # Don't do this
cf_export MY_VAR # Correct syntax
```



#### Masking variables within `cf_export`

Mask variables within `cf_export` by defining the `--mask` flag.  
Values of masked variables in `cf_export` commands are replaced with asterisks in the build logs. This helps to ensure that sensitive information is not exposed also in the variables list, in addition to the logs. 

Here is an example with standard and masked versions of the same variable in `cf_export` commands.

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  freestyle-step:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      - export EXISTING_VAR=some-value

      - cf_export VAR1=alpine:latest VAR2=VALUE2 EXISTING_VAR --mask
{% endraw %}      
{% endhighlight %}




#### Export variables to all steps with `cf_export`

By default, `cf_export` works only on *subsequent* steps.  
To export a variable both in the current and to all the remaining steps, do the following:

```
export MY_VAR='example' # Makes MY_VAR available in this step only
cf_export MY_VAR='example' # Makes MY_VAR available also to all steps after this one
```

There is nothing really magic about `cf_export`. It is a normal script. You can see its contents on your own by entering the command `cat /codefresh/volume/cf_export` on any [Codefresh freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/) inside a pipeline.

For more information on its limitations, see the [troubleshooting page]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/kb/articles/cf-export-limitations/).

 
### Directly writing to the file

For more advanced use cases, you can write directly to the shared variable file that Codefresh reads to understand which variables need to be available to all steps.

This file has a simple format where each line is a variable and its value in the form of `VARIABLE=VALUE`. The `cf_export` command mentioned in the previous section is just a shorthand for writing on this file.

The variables file is available inside freestyle steps in the following path: **`{% raw %}${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}{% endraw %}/env_vars_to_export`** 

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  freestyle-step-1:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      - echo VAR1=192.168.0.1 >> ${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}/env_vars_to_export
      - echo hey=alpine:3.9 >> ${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}/env_vars_to_export
          
  freestyle-step-2:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling 2
    image: ${{hey}}
    commands:
      - echo http://$VAR1/index.php
{% endraw %}      
{% endhighlight %}

Use this technique if you have complex expressions that have issues with the `cf_export` command.

## Masking variables in logs

Codefresh has the built-in capability to automatically mask variables in logs if they are encrypted. The values of encrypted variables will be replaced with asterisks in build logs.

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/variables/masked-variables.png"
url="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/variables/masked-variables.png"
alt="Masked variables"
caption="Masked variables"
max-width="80%"
%}

The variables can be defined in any of the usual ways Codefresh offers such as [shared configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/shared-configuration/) or [within the pipeline]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#pipeline-settings):

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/variables/encrypted-variables.png"
url="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/variables/encrypted-variables.png"
alt="Encrypted variables"
caption="Encrypted variables"
max-width="60%"
%}

>Notice that this feature is currently available only in Enterprise accounts.


## Encrypt variables for pipeline build runs

When you run a pipeline manually, you can either add variables on the fly or change the value of existing variables for the specific run of the build.
You can also encrypt the build-specific variables, new or existing, at the same time. 

1. Do one of the following:
  * From the Pipelines page, select the pipeline and click **Run** on the right.
  * From the Builds page, select the pipeline to run manually, and then click **Run**.
1. Expand Build Variables.
1. To add a variable, click **Add Variable**.
    1. Enter the **Key** and **Value** for the new variable.
    1. To encrypt, click {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/encrypt.png"  display=inline-block> <b>Encrypt</b>{:/}, and confirm. 

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/pipeline/variables/encrypt-build-variable.png"
url="/images/pipeline/variables/encrypt-build-variable.png"
alt="Encrypt variable for build run"
caption="Encrypt variable for build run"
max-width="50%"
%}

## Escape special characters in variables
When passing special characters through environmental variables, use `\` as an escape character.  
For example, to pass a cassandra connection string, you might do something like `Points\=hostname\;Port\=16376\;Username\=user\;Password\=password`. 

This will safely escape `;` and `=`.
