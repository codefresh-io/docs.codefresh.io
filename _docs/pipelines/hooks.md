Hooks in pipelines allow you to run specific actions at the end and the beginning of the pipeline, as well as before/after a step.

Hooks can be a [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/), as you need to define:

1. A Docker image that will be used to run specific commands.
1. One or more commands to run within the context of that Docker image.

For simple commands we suggest you use a small image such as `alpine`, but any Docker image can be used in hooks.

## Pipeline hooks

Codefresh allows you to run a specific step before each pipeline as well as after it has finished.

### Running a step at the end of the pipeline

You can easily run a step at the end of pipeline, that will execute even if one of the steps have failed (and thus the pipeline is stopped in middle):

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_finish:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "cleanup after end of pipeline"

steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Hello world"
  step2:
    title: "Step 2"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "There was an error"
      - exit 1   
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above we define a hook for the whole pipeline that will run a step (the `exec` keyword) inside `alpine:3.9` and will simply execute an `echo` command. Because we have used the `on_finish` keyword, this step will execute even if the whole pipeline fails.

This scenario is very common if you have a cleanup step or a notification step that you always want to run at the end of the pipeline. You will see the cleanup logs in the top pipeline step.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/hooks/cleanup-step.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/hooks/cleanup-step.png" 
alt="Running a cleanup step" 
caption="Running a cleanup step" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

Apart from the `on_finish` keyword you can also use `on_success` and `on_fail` if you want the step to only execute according to a specific result of the pipeline. It is also possible to use multiple hooks at the same time:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_finish:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "cleanup after end of pipeline"
 on_success:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "Send a notification only if pipeline was successful"
 on_fail:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "Send a notification only if pipeline has failed"       
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Hello world"
  step2:
    title: "Step 2"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "There was an error"
      - exit 1 #Comment this line out to see how hooks change

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Note that if you have multiple hooks like the example above, the `on_finish` segment will always execute after any `on_success`/`on_fail` segments (if they are applicable).


### Running a step at the start of the pipeline

Similar to the end of the pipeline, you can also execute a step at the beginning of the pipeline with the `on_elected` keyword:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_elected:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "Creating an adhoc test environment"
 on_finish:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "Destroying test environment"
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Integration tests on test environment"
  step2:
    title: "Step 2"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running acceptance tests on test environment"

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

All pipeline hooks will be shown in the "initializing process" logs:

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/hooks/before-pipeline.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/hooks/before-pipeline.png" 
alt="Hooks before a pipeline" 
caption="Hooks before a pipeline" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

It is possible to define all possible hooks (`on_elected`, `on_finish`, `on_success`, `on_fail`) in a single pipeline, if this is required by your development process.

## Step hooks

You can also define hooks for individual steps inside a pipeline. This capability allows you to enforce more granular control on defining prepare/cleanup phases for specific steps. 

The syntax for step hooks is the same as pipeline hooks:  `on_elected`, `on_finish`, `on_success`, `on_fail`. The only difference is that you need to add the respective segment within a step instead of the at the root of the pipeline.

For example, this pipeline will always run a cleanup step after integration tests (even if the tests themselves fail).

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Compile application"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Building application"
  step2:
    title: "Unit testing"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running unit tests"
    hooks:
      on_finish:
        exec:
          image: alpine:3.9
          commands:
          - echo "Create test report"
  step3:
    title: "Uploading artifact"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Upload to artifactory"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


Logs for steps hooks are displayed in the log window of the step itself.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/hooks/step-after.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/codefresh-yaml/hooks/step-after.png" 
alt="Hooks before a pipeline" 
caption="Hooks before a pipeline" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

As with pipeline hooks, you can also define multiple hook conditions for each step.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Compile application"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Building application"
  step2:
    title: "Security scanning"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Security scan"
    hooks:
      on_elected:
        exec:
          image: alpine:3.9
          commands:
          - echo "Authenticating to security scanning service"    
      on_finish:
        exec:
          image: alpine:3.9
          commands:
          - echo "Uploading security scan report"
      on_fail:
        exec:
          image: alpine:3.9
          commands:
          - echo "Sending slack notification"          

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The order of events in the example above is the following:

1. The `on_elected` segment executes first (authentication)
1. The `Security Scanning` step itself executes the security scan
1. The `on_fail` segment executes only if the step throws an error code
1. The `on_finish` segment always executes at the end


### Running steps/plugins in hooks

Hooks can use [steps/plugins](https://steps.codefresh.io){:target="\_blank"}.  
With plugins you have to specify:
- The type field for the step/plugin
- The arguments needed for the step/plugin

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"

hooks: #run slack-notifier hook on build completion
  on_finish:
    steps:
      exec:
        type: slack-notifier
        arguments:
          SLACK_HOOK_URL: '${{SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}}'
          SLACK_TEXT: '${{SLACK_TEXT}}' 

steps:
  step1:
    title: "Freestyle step"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: alpine
    commands:
      - echo "Codefresh"
    hooks: #run slack-notifier hook on step completion
      on_finish:
        steps:
          exec:
            type: slack-notifier
            arguments:
              SLACK_HOOK_URL: '${{SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}}'
              SLACK_TEXT: '${{SLACK_TEXT}}'       
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Controlling errors inside pipeline/step hooks

By default, if a step fails within a pipeline, pipeline execution is terminated and the pipeline is marked as failed.  
* `on_elected` segments  
  If `on_elected` segments fail, regardless of the position of the segment in a pipeline or step, the whole pipeline will fail. 
* `on_success`, `on_fail` and `on_finish` segments  
  `on_success`, `on_fail` and `on_finish` segments do not affect the pipeline outcome. A pipeline will continue execution even if one of these segments fails.

**Pipeline execution example with `on_elected` segment**  
The following pipeline will fail right away, because the pipeline hook fails at the beginning.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_elected:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "failing on purpose"
       - exit 1 
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Integration tests on test environment"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can change this behavior by using the existing [fail_fast property]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/#execution-flow) inside an `on_elected` hook.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_elected:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     fail_fast: false
     commands:
       - echo "failing on purpose"
       - exit 1 
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Integration tests on test environment"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


This pipeline will now execute successfully and `step1` will still run as normal, because we have used the `fail_fast` property. You can also use the `fail_fast` property on step hooks as well:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Integration tests on test environment"
    hooks: 
     on_elected:
       exec:
         image: alpine:3.9
         fail_fast: false
         commands:
         - echo "failing on purpose"
         - exit 1 
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


>**NOTE**   
  The `fail_fast` property is only available for `on_elected` hooks. The other types of hooks (`on_finish`, `on_success`, `on_fail`) do not affect the outcome of the pipeline in any way. Even if they fail, the pipeline will continue running to completion. This behavior is not configurable.


### Using multiple steps for hooks

In all the previous examples, each hook was a single step running on a single Docker image. You can also define multiple steps for each hook. This is possible by inserting an extra `steps` keyword inside the hook and listing multiple Docker images under it:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_finish:
   steps:
     mycleanup:
       image: alpine:3.9
       commands:
         - echo "echo cleanup step"
     mynotification:
       image: cloudposse/slack-notifier
       commands:
         - echo "Notify slack"
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Step 1"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Integration tests on test environment"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

By default all steps in a single hook segment are executed one after the other. But you can also run them in [parallel]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/advanced-workflows/#inserting-parallel-steps-in-a-sequential-pipeline):

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
steps:
  step1:
    title: "Compile application"
    type: "freestyle"
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Building application"
  step2:
    title: "Unit testing"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: node:10-buster
    commands:
      - echo "Running Integration tests"
      - exit 1 
    hooks:
      on_fail:
        mode: parallel
        steps:
          upload-my-artifact:
            image: maven:3.5.2-jdk-8-alpine
            commands:
            - echo "uploading artifact" 
          my-report:
            image: alpine:3.9
            commands:
            - echo "creating test report" 
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can use multiple steps in a hook in both the pipeline and the step level. 

### Referencing the 'working_directory' in step hooks
To access the [`working_directory`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/#working-directories) of a regular step through a hook, use the prefix `parentSteps.<step-name>` For example, to access the `working_directory` of the `clone` step, use {% raw %} `${{parentSteps.clone}}` {% endraw %}.  



## Using annotations and labels in hooks

The hook syntax can also be used as a unified interface for encompassing the existing syntax of [build annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/annotations/) and [metadata]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/docker-image-metadata/).

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks: 
 on_elected:
   exec:
     image: alpine:3.9
     commands:
       - echo "Creating an adhoc test environment"
   annotations:
     set:
        - entity_type: build
          annotations:
          - my_annotation_example1: 10.45
          - my_string_annotation: Hello World
steps:
  clone:
    title: Cloning source code
    type: git-clone
    arguments:
      repo: 'codefresh-contrib/golang-sample-app'
      revision: master
  build-image:
    type: build
    image_name: my-golang-image
    working_directory: '${{clone}}'
    tag: master
    hooks:
      on_success:
        exec:
          image: alpine:3.9
          commands:
            - echo "Scanning docker image"
        metadata: # setting metadata
          set:
           - '${{build-image.imageId}}':
               - status: 'Success'       
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Note however, that if you decide to use annotations and metadata inside hooks, you cannot mix and max the old syntax with the new syntax.

The following pipeline is **NOT** valid:

`invalid-codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
steps:
 test:
   image: alpine
   on_success: # you cannot use old style together with hooks
     annotations:
       set:
         - entity_type: build
           annotations:
             - status: 'success'
   commands:
     - echo block
   hooks:
     on_success:
       annotations:
         set:
           - entity_type: build
             annotations:
               - status: 'success'  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The pipeline is not correct, because the first segment of annotations is directly under `on_success` (the old syntax), while the second segment is under `hooks/on_success` (the new syntax).


## Syntactic sugar syntax

We offer the following options to simplify the syntax for hooks.

### Not using metadata or annotations in your hook
Omit the keyword `exec`:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks:
 on_finish:  # no exec keyword
   image: notifications:master
   commands:
     - ./send_workflow_finished.js
steps:
 build:
   type: build
   image_name: my_image
   tag: master
   hooks:
     on_fail: # no exec keyword
       image: notifications:master
       commands:
         - ./send_build_failed.js
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


### Not specifying the Docker image**  
If you do not want to specify the Docker image you can simply omit it. Codefresh will use the `alpine` image in that case to run the hook:


 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
hooks:
 on_elected: 
  exec: # no image keyword - alpine image will be used
    - echo "Pipeline starting"
steps:
 build:
   type: build
   image_name: my_image
   tag: master
   hooks:
     on_success: # no image keyword - alpine image will be used
       exec:
         - echo "Docker image was built successfully"
       annotations:
         set:
           - entity_type: build
             annotations:
               - status: 'Success'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}




## Using Type Steps/Plugins in hooks

You can use a type step / plugins in hooks.  With this you will need to change `exec` into `steps` with the information needed for the step.  

Below is an example pipeline hook using the `slack-notifier` step/plugin for when the pipeline starts.

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
hooks:
  on_elected:
    steps:
      exec:
        slack_pending:
          type: slack-notifier
          arguments:
            SLACK_HOOK_URL: '${{SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}}'
            SLACK_TEXT: '*Build Started* now'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

## Limitations of pipeline/step hooks

With the current implementation of hooks, the following limitations are present:

* The [debugger]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/debugging-pipelines/) cannot inspect commands inside hook segments.
* Hooks are not supported for [parallel steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/advanced-workflows/).
* Storage integrations don't resolve in hooks (for example, [test reports]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/test-reports/#producing-allure-test-reports-from-codefresh-pipelines)).
