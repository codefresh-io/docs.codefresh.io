Codefresh has a native module for GitOps deployments powered by Argo CD and Argo Rollouts. It also has native support for Argo Events and Argo Workflows.

* Create an [Argo CD Application]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/) either from the GUI or the CLI.
* [Monitor your Argo CD applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/) and check their health status
* You can [edit/delete/rollback]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/manage-application/) applications while still keeping the state in Git.
* Perform [Canary releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/install-argo-rollouts/) via the dedicated UI.

Explore our unique GitOps [Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/gitops-environments/) and [Products]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/gitops-products/) dashboards, designed for visualizing, monitoring, and managing Argo CD applications within their deployment environments.
