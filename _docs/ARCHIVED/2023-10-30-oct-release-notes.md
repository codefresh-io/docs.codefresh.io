## Features & enhancements

### Transition to OCI repositories

In a significant upgrade to our repository management system, Codefresh has transitioned from Chart Museum to OCI (Open Container Initiative) repositories. This change enhances the performance and reliability for Codefresh on-premises and GitOps Runtimes.




## Bug fixes

* Slow performance/response within Codefresh UI.
* Events missing from Audit log.

**Pipelines**  
* Bitbucket builds triggered for events not defined in pipeline. 
* Slow loading for Builds and Workflow pages for pipelines. 
* Restarting a Cron build or restarting a Cron build from a failed step results in error: "There was a problem rebuilding the selected item. Please make sure that the branch <BRANCH> is accessible". 
* Plan-time validation of the Cron expression field in `codefresh_pipeline` does not match API constraints.
* Cannot save views including Annotations as filters. 
* Statuses in build log outputs not color-coded.
* Memory usage graph in Builds page shows **Mib** instead of **MiB**. 



<br>


**GitOps**  
* `codefresh-image-reporter` failure for ECR (Elastic Container Registry) images.
* Deleting cluster results in `Failed deleting cluster` error message.
* (On-premises only) Cannot apply multiple namespaces to GitOps Runtime via Kustomize.
