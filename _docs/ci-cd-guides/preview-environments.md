In the [previous guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ci-cd-guides/environment-deployments/) we have seen how you can handle deployments to predefined environments (QA/Staging/production).

Another type of environments that you should manage is dynamic temporary environments for each pull request. For this type
of environments it is best if you create dynamically an environment when a Pull Request is created and tear it down when the Pull Request is closed.

This way each developer is working in isolation and can test their feature on its own. This pattern comes in contrast with  the traditional way of reusing static preexisting environments.

With Kubernetes you don't need to book and release specific test environments any more. Testing environments should
be handled in a transient way.

## Preview environments with Kubernetes

There are many ways to create temporary environments with Kubernetes, but the simplest one is to use
different namespaces, one for each pull request. So a pull request with name `fix-db-query` will
be deployed to a namespace called `fix-db-query`, a pull request with name `JIRA-1434` will be deployed to a namespace called  
`JIRA-1434` and so on.

The second aspect is exposing the environment URL so that developers and testers can actually preview the application
deployment either manually or via automated tests.

The two major approaches here are with host-based URLs or path based URLs.

* In host based urls, the test environments are named `pr1.example.com`, `pr2.example.com` and so on
* with path based URLs, the test environments are named `example.com/pr1` , `example.com/pr2` and so on

Both approaches have advantages and disadvantages. Path based URLs are easier to setup but may not work with all applications (since they change the web context). Host based URLs are more robust but need extra
DNS configuration for the full effect

In Kubernetes clusters, both ways can be setup via [an Ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/).

## The example application

The application we will use can be found at [https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/unlimited-test-environments-source-code](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/unlimited-test-environments-source-code). It is a standard Java/Spring boot application with the following characteristics.

* It has [integration tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/integration-tests/) that can be targeted at any host/port. We will use those tests as smoke test that will verify the preview environment after it is deployed
* It comes bundled in [a Helm chart](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/unlimited-test-environments-manifests)
* It has an ingress configuration ready for path based URLs

We are using [the Ambassador gateway](https://www.getambassador.io/) as an ingress for this example, but you can use any other compliant Kubernetes Ingress.

Here is [ingress manifest](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/unlimited-test-environments-manifests/blob/main/simple-java-app/templates/ingress.yaml)

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
kind: Ingress
apiVersion: extensions/v1beta1
metadata:
  name: "simple-java-app-ing"
  annotations:
    kubernetes.io/ingress.class: {{ .Values.ingress.class }}

spec:
  rules:
    - http:
        paths:
          - path: {{ .Values.ingress.path }}
            backend:
              serviceName: simple-service
              servicePort: 80
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The path of the application is configurable and can be set at deploy time.

## Creating preview environments for each pull request

Each time a Pull Request is created we want to perform the following tasks:

1. Compile the application and run unit tests
1. Run security scans, quality checks and everything else we need to decided if the Pull request is valid
1. Create a namespace with the same name as the pull request branch. Deploy the pull Request and expose it as a URL
that has the same name as the branch as well

Here is an example pipeline that does all these tasks

{% include image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/guides/preview-environments/pull-request-preview-pipeline.png"
url="/images/guides/preview-environments/pull-request-preview-pipeline.png"
alt="Pull Request preview pipeline"
caption="Pull Request preview pipeline"
max-width="100%"
%}

This pipeline has the following steps

1. A [clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/git-clone/) to fetch the source code of the application
1. A [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/) that runs Maven for compilation and unit tests
1. A [build step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/build/) to create the docker image of the application
1. A step that scans the source code for security issues with [Snyk](https://snyk.io/)
1. A step that scans the container image [for security issues]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/security-scanning/) with [trivy](https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy)
1. A step that runs [integration tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/integration-tests/) by launching the app in a [service container]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/service-containers/)
1. A step for [Sonar analysis]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/sonarqube-integration/)
1. A step that clones [a second Git repository](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/unlimited-test-environments-manifests) that has the [Helm chart]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/) of the app
1. A step that deploys the source code to a new namespace.
1. A step that [adds a comment on the Pull Request](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/kostis-codefresh%2Fgithub-pr-comment) with the URL of the temporary environment
1. A step that runs smoke tests against the temporary test environment

Note that the integration tests and security scans are just examples of what you can do before the Pull Request is deployed. You can insert your own steps that check the contents of a Pull Request.

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The end result of the pipeline is a deployment on the path that has the same name as the pull request branch. For
example if my branch is named `demo` then a demo namespace is created on the cluster and the application
is exposed on the `/demo/` context:

{% include image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/guides/preview-environments/demo-path.png"
url="/images/guides/preview-environments/demo-path.png"
alt="Temporary environment"
caption="Temporary environment"
max-width="100%"
%}

The environment is also mentioned as a comment in the Pull Request UI in Gituhub:

{% include image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/guides/preview-environments/pull-request-comment.png"
url="/images/guides/preview-environments/pull-request-comment.png"
alt="Pull Request comment"
caption="Pull Request comment"
max-width="100%"
%}

As explained it the [previous guide for Pull Requests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/ci-cd-guides/pull-request-branches/), we want to make this pipeline applicable only
to PR open event and PR sync events (which captures commits that happen on an existing pull request).

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true"
file="/images/guides/preview-environments/pr-events.png"
url="/images/guides/preview-environments/pr-events.png"
alt="Git events for a Pull Request preview pipeline"
caption="Git events for a Pull Request preview pipeline"
max-width="100%"
%}

Therefore you need to setup your [triggers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/triggers/git-triggers/) with the same checkboxes shown in the picture above.

## Cleaning up temporary environments

Creating temporary environments is very convenient for developers but can be very costly for your infrastructure if you use a cloud
provider for your cluster. For cost reasons and better resource utilization it is best if temporary environments are destroyed if they are
no longer used.

While you can run a batch job, that automatically deletes old temporary environments, the optimal approach is to delete them as soon as
the respective Pull Request is closed.

We can do that with a very simple pipeline that has only one step:

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true"
file="/images/guides/preview-environments/pull-request-closed-pipeline.png"
url="/images/guides/preview-environments/pull-request-closed-pipeline.png"
alt="Pipeline when a Pull Request is closed"
caption="Pipeline when a Pull Request is closed"
max-width="100%"
%}

Here is the pipeline definition:

 `codefresh-close.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: "1.0"
steps:
  delete_app:
    title: Delete app
    type: helm
    arguments:
      action: auth
      helm_version: 3.2.4
      kube_context: myawscluster
      namespace: ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}
      commands:
            - helm delete my-spring-app --namespace ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}
            - kubectl delete namespace ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The pipeline just uninstall the Helm release for that namespace and then deletes the namespace itself.

To have this pipeline run only when a Pull Request is closed here is how your [trigger]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/triggers/git-triggers/)  should look:

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true"
file="/images/guides/preview-environments/close-events.png"
url="/images/guides/preview-environments/close-events.png"
alt="Git events for a Pull Request close pipeline"
caption="Git events for a Pull Request close pipeline"
max-width="100%"
%}

Notice that with this setup that pipeline will run when the pull request was closed regardless of wether it was merged or not (which is exactly what you want as in both cases the test environment is not needed anymore).
