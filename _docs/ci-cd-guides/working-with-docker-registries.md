Codefresh contains first-class Docker registry support. This means that you don't need to manually write `docker login` and `docker pull/push` commands within pipelines. You can use declarative YAML, and all credentials are configured in a central location once.

## Viewing Docker images

To see all images from [all connected registries]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/):

* In the Codefresh UI, from Artifacts in the sidebar, select [**Images**](https://g.codefresh.io/images/){:target="\_blank"}.  
  Each image displays basic details such as the Git branch, commit message, hash that created it, creation date, as well as all tags.

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/guides/working-with-images/docker-registry-list.png" 
  url="/images/guides/working-with-images/docker-registry-list.png" 
  alt="Codefresh Registry Image List" 
  caption="Codefresh Registry Image List" 
  max-width="70%" 
%}

* To view image metadata, click on the image. For details, see [Docker image metadata]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/docker-image-metadata/).


##### Filters for Docker images  
The top left of the Images page has several filters that allow you to search for a specific subset of Docker images.  
Filters include:  
* Tagged/untagged images
* Base image name
* Git branch
* Tag
* Pipeline volumes

Multiple filters work in an `AND` manner.

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/guides/working-with-images/docker-registry-filters.png" 
  url="/images/guides/working-with-images/docker-registry-filters.png" 
  alt="Codefresh Registry Image filters" 
  caption="Codefresh Registry Image filters" 
  max-width="40%" 
%}


##### Actions for Docker images  
On the right are the actions available foreach Docker image.  
You can:  
* Launch a Docker image as a [test environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/ci-quick-start/on-demand-environments/)
* Promote a Docker image (explained in the following sections)
* Pull the image locally on your workstation with different commands
* Re-run the pipeline that created the image


## Pulling Docker images

Pulling Docker images in Codefresh is completely automatic. You only need to mention a Docker image by name, and Codefresh  automatically pulls it for you and uses it in a pipeline. 

### Pulling public images

To pull a public image from Docker Hub or other public registries:

*  Specify the name of the image and tag that you want to use.  
  
For example:

```yaml
CollectAllMyDeps:
  title: Install dependencies
  image: python:3.6.4-alpine3.6
  commands:
    - pip install .
```

This [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/) pulls the image `python:3.6.4-alpine3.6` from Docker Hub, and then runs the command `pip install .` inside it.  
You can see the images that get pulled in the [Codefresh pipeline log]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/).

{% 
	include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/guides/working-with-images/pull-public-image.png" 
	url="/images/guides/working-with-images/pull-public-image.png" 
	alt="Pulling a public image" 
	caption="Pulling a public image" 
	max-width="70%" 
%}

The image is also automatically cached in the [image cache]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/pipeline-caching/#distributed-docker-image-caching).

Codefresh also automatically pull for you any images mentioned in Dockerfiles (i.e. the `FROM` directive) as well as [service containers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/service-containers/).


### Pulling private images

To pull a private image from one of your connected registries, in addition to specifying the image by name and tag, you must also prepend the appropriate prefix of the registry domain. The registry domain prefix is required for Codefresh to understand that it is a private image.

For example, in the case of ACR (Azure Container Registry):

```
registry-name.azurecr.io/my-docker-repo/my-image-name:tag
```

Get the full name of a Docker image:  
* In the Codefresh UI, from Artifacts in the sidebar, select [**Images**](https://g.codefresh.io/images/){:target="\_blank"}.
* Click on the image and copy the image name from the Activity column, **Image promoted** label.

{% 
	include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/guides/working-with-images/image-dashboard-tag.png" 
	url="/images/guides/working-with-images/image-dashboard-tag.png" 
	alt="Looking at tag of a private image" 
	caption="Looking at tag of a private image"
	max-width="65%" 
%}

The exact format of the image name depends on the type of registry you use. Codefresh uses the domain prefix of each image to understand which integration to use, and then takes care of all `docker login` and `docker pull` commands on its own behind the scenes.

For example, if you have connected [Azure]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/azure-docker-registry/), [AWS]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/amazon-ec2-container-registry/), and [Google]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/google-container-registry/) registries, you can pull three images for each in a pipeline like this:


 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  my_go_unit_tests:
    title: Running Go Unit tests
    image: 'us.gcr.io/project-k8s-sample-123454/my-golang-app:prod'
    commands:
      - go test -v
  my_mvn_unit_tests:
    title: Running Maven Unit tests
    image: '123456789012.dkr.ecr.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/my-java-app:latest'
    commands:
      - mvn test
  my_python_unit_tests:
    title: Running Python Unit tests
    image: 'my-azure-registry.azurecr.io/kostis-codefresh/my-python-app:master'
    commands:
      - python setup.py test        
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Codefresh automatically logs in to each registry using the credentials you have defined centrally, and pulls all the images. The same thing will happen with Dockerfiles that mention any valid Docker image in their `FROM` directive.


### Pulling images created in the same pipeline

Codefresh allows you to create a Docker image on demand and use it in the same pipeline that created it. In several scenarios (such as [unit tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/unit-tests/)), it is very common to use a Docker image right after it is built.

In that case, as a shortcut, Codefresh allows you to simply [specify the name]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#context-related-variables) of the respective [build step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/).

 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    repo: 'codefresh-contrib/python-flask-sample-app'
    revision: 'master'
    git: github
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    working_directory: ./
    tag: 'master'
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running Unit tests
    image: '${{MyAppDockerImage}}'
    commands:
      - python setup.py test
  
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the above pipeline, Codefresh:

1. Checks out source code through a [git-clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/).
1. Builds a Docker image, named `my-app-image:master`. Notice the lack of `docker push` commands.
1. In the next step, automatically uses that image and runs `python setup.py test` inside it. Again, notice the lack of `docker pull` commands.

The important line here is the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
{% endraw %}    
{% endhighlight %}

This says to Codefresh "in this step please use the Docker image that was built in the step named `MyAppDockerImage`".

You can see the automatic pull inside the Codefresh logs.

{% 
	include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/guides/working-with-images/pull-private-image.png" 
	url="/images/guides/working-with-images/pull-private-image.png" 
	alt="Auto-Pulling a private image" 
	caption="Auto-Pulling a private image" 
	max-width="70%" 
%}

The image is still pushed to your default Docker registry. If you don't want this behavior, add the `disable_push` property in the build step.


## Pushing Docker images

Pushing to your default Docker registry is completely automatic. All successful [build steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/) automatically push to the default Docker registry of your Codefresh account without any extra configuration.

To push to another registry, you only need to know how this registry is [connected to Codefresh]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/), and more specifically, what is the unique name of the integration. You can see the name in the Codefresh UI, in [Docker Registry integrations](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/account-conf/integration/registryNew){:target="\_blank"}, or asking your Codefresh administrator.


{% 
	include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/guides/working-with-images/linked-docker-registries.png" 
	url="/images/guides/working-with-images/linked-docker-registries.png" 
	alt="Name of linked Docker Registries" 
	caption="Name of linked Docker Registries" 
	max-width="50%" 
%}

Once you know the registry identifier, you can use it in any [push step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/push/) or [build step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/) by specifying the registry with that name:

 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  build_image:
    title: Building my app image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tag: 'master'
  push_to_registry:
    title: Pushing to Docker Registry 
    type: push
    #Name of the build step that is building the image
    candidate: '${{build_image}}'
    tag: '1.2.3'
    # Unique registry name
    registry: azure-demo       
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that
 * the `candidate` field of the push step mentions the name of the build step (`build_image`) that will be used for the image to be pushed.
 * The registry is only identified by name (`azure-demo` in the example). The domain and credentials are not part of the pipeline as they are already known to Codefresh through the Docker registry integration.

 You can also override the name of the image with any custom name. This way the push step can choose any image name regardless of what was used in the build step.

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  build_image:
    title: Building my app image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    tag: 'master'
  push_to_registry:
    title: Pushing to Docker Registry 
    type: push
    #Name of the build step that is building the image
    candidate: '${{build_image}}'
    tag: '1.2.3'
    # Unique registry name
    registry: azure-demo
    image_name: my-company/web-app       
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Here the build step creates an image named `my-app-image:master`,  but the push step actually pushes it as `my-company/web-app:1.2.3`.

For more examples, such as using multiple tags, or pushing in parallel, see the [push examples]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/push/#examples).

### Pushing images with an optional prefix

There are some registry providers that require a specific prefix for all your Docker images. This is often the name of an organization, account, or other top-level construct defined by the registry.

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  build:
    title: "Building Docker image"
    type: "build"
    image_name: "acme-company/trivial-go-web"
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    tag: "latest"
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile.multistage"
    stage: "build"
    registry: azure
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The example above will push the final Docker image as `kostisazureregistry.azurecr.io/acme-company/trivial-go-web:latest`.  

However, you can also set up the prefix globally once in the [Docker registry integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/). This way you can simplify your pipelines and have them mention only the final image name.

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/guides/working-with-images/registry-prefix.png" 
  url="/images/guides/working-with-images/registry-prefix.png" 
  alt="Global registry prefix" 
  caption="Global registry prefix" 
  max-width="70%" 
%}

Using the repository prefix in the example above, automatically prefixes all your Docker images with `acme-company`.

Now you can simplify your build/push step as below:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  build:
    title: "Building Docker image"
    type: "build"
    image_name: "trivial-go-web"
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    tag: "latest"
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile.multistage"
    stage: "build"
    registry: azure
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The final Docker image will still be `kostisazureregistry.azurecr.io/acme-company/trivial-go-web:latest`.

## Working with multiple registries with the same domain

With Codefresh, you can [connect multiple registries on a global level]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/). This allows you to create pipelines that push/pull images to different registries without having to deal with Docker credentials within the pipeline itself.

However, there are several times where you have multiple registries that have the same domain. For example, you might have two Docker Hub accounts connected to Codefresh (so both of them can resolve images for the `docker.io` domain).

This means that when you reference an image by domain name, as in a freestyle step for example, Codefresh might not know which Docker registry account to use for the pull action.

>**NOTE**  
This is not a Codefresh limitation, but a Docker one. Even with vanilla Docker you cannot log in to multiple registries at the same time if they share the same domain.

To solve this problem, Codefresh automatically detects connected registries that have the same domain and allow you to designate the primary one. The primary registry is used for image resolution when pulling Docker images.

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/guides/working-with-images/primary-dockerhub.png" 
  url="/images/guides/working-with-images/primary-dockerhub.png" 
  alt="Choosing a Docker registry as the primary one if they have the same domain" 
  caption="Choosing a Docker registry as the primary one if they have the same domain"
  max-width="90%" 
%}

In the example above, even though two Docker Hub integrations are connected to Codefresh, only the primary one is used to pull images from the `docker.io` domain. You can still use the second one in push/build steps using the `registry` property.

You can override the default behavior in each pipeline, by adding the optional `registry_context` property to instruct Codefresh on how to use a specific registry for pulling Docker images (if you have more than one for the same domain).



You can use the `registry_context` property in [build]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/), [push]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/push/), [freestyle]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/), and [composition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/composition/) steps.

The `registry_context` property takes as value the name of an external connected registry. Build and composition steps accept an array of values as `registry_contexts`. In all cases, by using this optional property you instruct Codefresh to use a specific registry for pulling images.

>**NOTE**  
The optional `registry_context` and `registry_contexts` properties only affect the **pulling** of Docker images. The registry used for *pushing* images is still declared explicitly in build and push pipeline steps.

The syntax for the freestyle step is the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  test:
    title: "Running test"
    type: "freestyle" 
    image: "gcr.io/my-google-project/my-image:latest"
    registry_context: my-second-gcr-registry # define what registry will be used for pulling the image
    working_directory: "${{clone}}" 
    commands:
      - "ls"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax for the build step is the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  build:
    title: "Building Docker image"
    type: "build"
    image_name: "trivial-go-web"
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    tag: "latest"
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile.multistage"
    stage: "build"
    registry_contexts: # define what registries will be used for pulling images
      - second-dockerhub
      - production-azure
    registry: azure
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


The syntax for the push step is the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  push:
    title: "Pushing 1st Docker image"
    type: push
    image_name: "kostiscodefresh/trivial-go-web"
    tag: "latest"
    stage: "push" 
    registry: dockerhub # Docker registry to push to 
    registry_context: second-dockerhub # Docker registry to pull images from
    candidate: ${{build}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The syntax for the composition step is the following:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  my-composition:
    title: Running Composition
    type: composition
    registry_contexts: 
      - first-gcr
      - second-gcr
    arguments:
      composition:
        version: '2'
        services:
          db:
            image: postgres
      composition_candidates:
        test_service:
          image: 'alpine:3.9'
          command: printenv
          working_dir: /app
          environment:
            - key=value
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Let's look at an example. We assume that we have two GCR integrations:

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/guides/working-with-images/two-gcr-integrations.png" 
  url="/images/guides/working-with-images/two-gcr-integrations.png" 
  alt="Two GCR integrations" 
  caption="Two GCR integrations" 
  max-width="90%" 
%}

The first integration is the "production" one, and the second integration is the "staging" one. The production one is designated as primary. This means that by default even though both integrations work for the `gcr.io` domain, only the primary one is used in the Codefresh pipeline for pulling images.

Let's say however that you want to build a Docker image that has a `FROM` statement from an image that exists in the staging registry. The image should be pushed to the production registry. You can use the `registry_context` property as shown below:


{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  build:
    title: "Building Docker image"
    type: "build"
    image_name: "gcr.io/production-project/my-image"
    working_directory: "${{clone}}"
    tag: "latest"
    dockerfile: "Dockerfile"
    stage: "build"
    registry: production-gcr
    registry_contexts: # define what registries will be used for pulling images
      - staging-gcr
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Behind the scenes Codefresh will:

1. First log in to the "staging" Docker registry using the "staging" credentials.
1. Build the Docker image, by resolving the `FROM` statements with "staging" images, pulling them as needed using the staging credentials.
1. Tag the Docker image.
1. Log in to the "production" Docker registry.
1. Push the final Docker image to the "production" registry.

If your primary Docker registry is also the one that is used in your pipelines, you don't need the `registry_context` property at all, as this is the default behavior. When searching for an image to pull Codefresh will look at all your Docker registries (if they manage only a single domain), plus your "primary" Docker registries in case you have multiple Docker registries for the same domain.

## Promoting Docker images

Apart from building and pushing a brand new Docker image, you can also "promote" a Docker image by copying it from one registry to another. 
You can perform this action either from the Codefresh UI or automatically from pipelines.


### Promoting images via the Codefresh UI

You have the capability to "promote" any image of your choosing and push it to an external registry you have integrated into Codefresh (such as Azure, Google, Bintray etc.).


1. In the Codefresh UI, from Artifacts in the sidebar, select [**Images**](https://g.codefresh.io/images/){:target="\_blank"}.
1. To promote an image, in the row with the image, click the **Promote Image** icon on the right.

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/guides/working-with-images/docker-image-promotion.png" 
  url="/images/guides/working-with-images/docker-image-promotion.png" 
  alt="Promoting a Docker image" 
  caption="Promoting a Docker image" 
  max-width="50%" 
%}

{:start="3"}
1. From the list of connected registries, select the target registry, and define the tag that you want to push. 
1. To "copy" this image from the existing registry to the target registry, click **Promote**.

### Promoting images in pipelines

You can also copy images from one registry to the other within a pipeline.
This is accomplished by specifying an existing image in the `candidate` field of the push step.

For example:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  promote_to_production_registry:
    title: Promoting to Azure registry 
    type: push
    candidate: us.gcr.io/project-k8s-sample-123454/my-golang-app
    tag: '1.2.3'
    # Unique registry name
    registry: azure-demo      
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, we promote an image from [GCR]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/google-container-registry/) to [ACR]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/azure-docker-registry/), which is already set up as `azure-demo`.

You can even "promote" Docker images within the same registry by simply creating new tags.  
For example:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  promote_to_production:
    title: Marking image with prod tag
    type: push
    candidate: my-azure-registry.azurecr.io/kostis-codefresh/my-python-app:1.2.3
    tag: 'production'
    # Unique registry name
    registry: azure-demo      
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In the example above, the image `my-azure-registry.azurecr.io/kostis-codefresh/my-python-app:1.2.3` is re-tagged as `my-azure-registry.azurecr.io/kostis-codefresh/my-python-app:prod`. A very common pattern is to mark images with a special tag such as `prod` **after** the image has been deployed successfully.
