This article describes how to configure the different Product Settings:

* [Assign applications](#copy-product-annotation-to-connect-applications)  

[Define Promotion Flows](#define-promotion-flows)
[Define Promotion Settings]()

##### Form & YAML modes
As with most entities, you have the option to configure Product Settings in Form or YAML modes, and switch seamlessly between them during configuration.

The Product CRD stores all product settings, except applications manually assigned to the product. These are stored locally.

You can configure new and update existing settings whenever needed and in



Annotations and labels are metadata attached to products, helping in organizing and managing resources more effectively.

The product annotation is added automatially when you create the product. Copy the annotation and paste in the manifests of the applications you want to connect to thpto connect applications for adding non-identifying metadata and labels for filtering and selecting resources.

Assign applications
Codefresh simplifies application assignment by providing the option to manually assign applications, right from the Product Settings in addition to the othe locations in the UI.



Promotion Flows


Promotion Settings
Fine-tune your promotion process by configuring wic properties  related to application promotion.

By utilizing these configuration options, you can optimize your CI/CD processes and maintain a well-organized, efficient workflow in Codefresh.

## Configure labels

## Configure Promotion Flows
Automate and orchestrate promotions across different environments for the Product by:
