Form & YAML modes
As with most entities, you have the option to configure Product Settings in Form or YAML modes, and switch between them seamlessly during configuration.
If you are more comfortable with YAML, see our Product CRD w


No matter what mode you use to configure, Product Settings are saved in the Product CRD. In ?????
The Product CRD stores all product settings, except applications manually assigned to the product. These are stored locally.

You can configure new and update existing settings whenever needed and in



Annotations and labels are metadata attached to products, helping in organizing and managing resources more effectively.

The product annotation is added automatially when you create the product. Copy the annotation and paste in the manifests of the applications you want to connect to thpto connect applications for adding non-identifying metadata and labels for filtering and selecting resources.

Assign applications
Codefresh simplifies application assignment by providing the option to manually assign applications, right from the Product Settings in addition to the othe locations in the UI.



Promotion Flows
Configure Promotion Flows to automate and orchestrate promotion through different stages of deployment. Configure these flows  and control the promotion of applications from one environment to another.

Promotion Settings
Fine-tune your promotion process by configuring wic properties  related to application promotion.

By utilizing these configuration options, you can optimize your CI/CD processes and maintain a well-organized, efficient workflow in Codefresh.

  1. **Operator**: The operator to apply when matching the Property, based on inclusion or exclusion, with or without wildcards.  
     `In`: Checks if the commit message or Git revision <i>includes</i> the specified value or any value within a set of values.   
     `NotIn`: Checks if the commit message or Git revision <i>does not include</i> the specified value or any value within a set of values.
  1. **Values**: Single or multiple values used to match or exclude Promotion Flows based on the Property and Operator configured. 
  1. To add more trigger conditions, click **Add** and repeat _steps 4.1 through 4.3_.

  If you select a predefined Template, the Version and Promotable Properties are populated with the settings already defined.

1. Define the source settings for the application version:
  1. **File**: The name of the file from which to retrieve the version. For example, `chart.yaml`. 
  1. **Path**: The JSON path to the attribute with the value. 
  1. To see the result for any application connected to the product, click **Preview Configuration** and then select an application to see its version. 

1. Define the settings for the Promotable Properties:
  1. **File**: The name of the file with the attributes to promote. For example, `values.yaml`. 
  1. **Paths**: The JSON path or paths to one or more attributes within the file to promote. For example, `$.buslog.image.tag` , `$.ctrlr.image.tag` and `$.flask-ui.image.tag`.
