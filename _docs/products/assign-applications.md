After creating products, the next step is to assign applications to it.
Assigning applications to products groups these applications into a single cohesive entity, enabling efficient management for promotions and deployments.

There are two methods of assigning applications to a product:

* Declarative assignment 
  Defines an annotation with the Product name in the application's manifest. If the Product doesnâ€™t exist, Codefresh automatically creates it for you.  
  The annotation is committed and saved in Git as part of the application definition.   
  Fully GitOps-compatible, this is the preferred method.   
  For how-to instructions, see [Connect applications to products with annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/configure-product-settings/#connect-applications-to-product-with-annotations).

* Manual assignment  
  A one-click action for quick assignment within Product Settings.  
  Unlike other UI actions, manual assignment does not require a commit action. Applications assigned to a product are not stored in the product's resource definition.  
  Recommended for testing purposes and not as the preferred method.  
  For how-to instructions, see [Manually assign unassigned applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/configure-product-settings/#manually-assign-unassigned-applications).

You can always unassign an application from a product, for declaratively assigned applications by [removing the annotation](#unassign-application-by-removing-annotation), and for manually assigned applications, by removing them through [Product Settings](#unassign-application-from-product-settings) .

 ## Use annotations to connect applications to products
Connect an application to a product declaratively by adding the predefined annotation to the application's manifest.

This is one of two methods for assigning applications to products. The other method is to [manually assign applications to the product](#manually-assign-applications-to-products).

### Step 1: Copy the product's annotation
1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Products**.
1. Do one of the following:
  * Mouse over the row with the Product to which to assign the application, and click {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/edit.png?display=inline-block">{:/}.
  * Click the Product for which to assign applications.  
  The **General** section in the Settings tab is displayed.
1. Below Connect Applications, copy the annotation to add to the application's manifest.


{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/gitops-products/settings/general-copy-annotation.png" 
	url="/images/gitops-products/settings/general-copy-annotation.png" 
	alt="Copy annotation for Product" 
	caption="Copy annotation for Product"
  max-width="60%" 
%}

### Step 2: Add the annotation to the application's manifest
1. Click the **Product Dashboard** tab. 
1. From the context menu of the application to which to add the application, select **Application Info > Go to application**.
1. Click the **Configuration** tab, and switch to **YAML** mode.
1. Paste below `metadata.annotations`.

{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/gitops-products/app-with-annotation.png" 
	url="/images/gitops-products/app-with-annotation.png" 
	alt="Add annotation to application manifest" 
	caption="Add annotation to application manifest"
  max-width="60%" 
%}

  {:start="7"}
1. Commit to save the changes.

If you return to the Products page and expand the product, you'll now see that the application is part of the Product.

## Manually assign applications to Products

Manually assign an application through the Product's Settings.

This is one of two methods for assigning applications to Products. The other method involves [adding annotations to the application's manifest](#use-annotations-to-connect-applications-to-products).


1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Products**.
1. If needed, search for the application, or filter by Application or Environment.
1. Do one of the following:
  * Mouse over the row with the Product to which to assign the application, and click {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/settings.png?display=inline-block">{:/}.
  * Click the name of the Product for which to assign application.  
 The list of Unassigned apps is displayed in **Settings > Manage Applications**.

{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/gitops-products/unassigned-apps-in-product.png" 
	url="/images/gitops-products/unassigned-apps-in-product.png" 
	alt="Unassigned applications in Product" 
	caption="Unassigned applications in Product"
  max-width="60%" 
%}

{:start="4"}
1. If needed, again search for applications or filter unassigned applications by **Environment**.
1. To assign an application, click {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/runtime-topology-add-cluster.png?display=inline-block">{:/}.  
1. To confirm the assignment, click **Save**. 
  If you have defined an Environment for the application, the application is automatically added to the Environment defined for it.


{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/gitops-products/assign-app-to-env.png" 
	url="/images/gitops-products/assign-app-to-env.png" 
	alt="Application assigned to Product in defined Environment" 
	caption="Application assigned to Product in defined Environment"
  max-width="60%" 
%}
