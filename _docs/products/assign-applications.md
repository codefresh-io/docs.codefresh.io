After creating products, the next step is to assign applications to it.
Assigning applications to products groups these applications into a single cohesive entity, enabling efficient management for promotions and deployments.

There are two methods of assigning applications to a product:

* Declarative assignment 
  Defines an annotation with the Product name in the application's manifest. If the Product doesnâ€™t exist, Codefresh automatically creates it for you.  
  The annotation is committed and saved in Git as part of the application definition.   
  Fully GitOps-compatible, this is the preferred method.   
  For how-to instructions, see [Connect applications to products with annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/configure-product-settings/#connect-applications-to-product-with-annotations).

* Manual assignment  
  A one-click action for quick assignment within Product Settings.  
  Unlike other UI actions, manual assignment does not require a commit action. Applications assigned to a product are not stored in the product's resource definition.  
  Recommended for testing purposes and not as the preferred method.  
  For how-to instructions, see [Manually assign unassigned applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/products/configure-product-settings/#manually-assign-unassigned-applications).

You can always unassign an application from a product, for declaratively assigned applications by removing the annotation, and for manually assigned applications, by removing them through [Product Settings](products/configure-product-settings/#unassign-manually-assigned-applications).
