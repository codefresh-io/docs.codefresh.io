## Product Releases
The **Releases** feature provides visibility into a productâ€™s deployment lifecycle as it moves through different environments during promotions.

A release is automatically created when a promotion is triggered, capturing the product and its application states at that moment. It allows you to monitor, visualize, and analyze changes from the initial trigger to final deployment, providing valuable insights for all stakeholders.

The Releases tab for a product lists both historical and ongoing releases.

	alt="Product Releases" 
	caption="Product Releases"
  max-width="50%" 
%}

##### Release visualization
Drilling into a specific release shows how promotions were orchestrated across environments using Promotion Workflows. The Release Notes compile all the changes leading up to the release.

##### Tracking releases in Git
Git commit status checks include promotion updates, allowing you to track progress and identify issues directly from Git. Clicking **Details** in Git takes you to the **Releases** view in Codefresh GitOps for further investigation.
