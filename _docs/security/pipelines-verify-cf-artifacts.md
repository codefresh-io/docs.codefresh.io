Any organization wanting to deploy container images created by Codefresh pipelines using Codefresh as the OIDC provider and keyless signing, can verify the signature and identity of the signer.

To use keyless signing for container images created by Codefresh pipelines, see [Securing container images with OIDC and keyless signing]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/#securing-container-images-with-oidc-and-keyless-signing).

You can find detailed information on keyless signing including architecture and comparisons in our [blog](https://codefresh.io/blog/securing-containers-oidc/){:target="\_blank"} on the same.

## Verify authenticity of Codefresh pipeline-created artifacts

Verify the authenticity of all artifacts created by Codefresh pipelines with this command:

`cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity/--certificate-identity-regexp "<certificate identity>" <image tag>`
 

where:  
* `--certificate-oidc-issuer` is always set to `"https://oidc.codefresh.io"`.
* `<certificate-identity>`is the identity of the certificate and can be set using either of the following flags:
    *  `--certificate-identity` for the full identity of the certificate.
    * `--certificate-identity-regexp` as a regular expression to flexibly mix and match various parts of the identity.
* `<imagetag>` is the name of the container image to verify.

Whichever option you use for certificate identification, when the identity doesnâ€™t match the signing certificate identity, cosign exits with an error:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/build-step/cosign-cert-verification-error.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/build-step/cosign-cert-verification-error.png"
alt="cosign certificate identity validation error" 
caption="cosign certificate identity validation error"
max-width="60%"
%}

On successful verification, cosign displays useful information about the signature such as the digest and the base64-encoded content of the signing certificate, as in the example below.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/build-step/cosign-cert-verification-success.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/build-step/cosign-cert-verification-success.png"
alt="Successful cosign certificate identity validation" 
caption="Successful cosign certificate identity validation"
max-width="60%"
%}

## Examples of identity verification commands


* Full identity verification

`cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity "https://g.codefresh.io/ilia-codefresh/sigstore-blog/keyless-signature:628a80b693a15c0f9c13ab75/6612ad6384ef42f18019b7e9" ilmedcodefresh/python-flask-sample-app:cosign-keyless-demo`.

* Regex verification for a specific immutable account ID:
  This command verifies identities for images created by any pipeline for a specific `account-id` with a regex:  

  `cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity-regexp "https://g.codefresh.io/.*:628a80b693a15c0f9c13ab75/.*" ilmedcodefresh/python-flask-sample-app:cosign-keyless-demo`

* Regex verification for a specific account name:  
  `cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity-regexp "https://g.codefresh.io/ilia-codefresh/.*" ilmedcodefresh/python-flask-sample-app:cosign-keyless-demo`
