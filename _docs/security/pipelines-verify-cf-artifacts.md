Organizations deploying container images created by Codefresh pipelines using Codefresh as the OIDC provider and keyless signing can verify both the signature and the identity of the signer.

For instructions on setting up keyless signing for container images created by Codefresh pipelines, see [Securing container images with OIDC and keyless signing]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/#securing-container-images-with-oidc-and-keyless-signing).

For detailed information including on keyless signing, including its architecture, [read our blog](https://codefresh.io/blog/securing-containers-oidc/){:target="\_blank"} on the same.


## Verify authenticity of Codefresh pipeline-created artifacts

Verify the authenticity of all artifacts created by Codefresh pipelines using the `cosign` command:

`cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity/--certificate-identity-regexp "<certificate identity>" <image tag>`
 

where:  
* `--certificate-oidc-issuer` is always set to `"https://oidc.codefresh.io"`.
* `<certificate-identity>`is the identity of the certificate, specified using one of the following flags:
    *  `--certificate-identity` for the full identity of the certificate.
    * `--certificate-identity-regexp` for specifying a regular expression to match various parts of the identity.
* `<imagetag>` is the name of the container image to verify.

If the certificate identity doesnâ€™t match the expected identity, `cosign` exits with an error:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

url="/images/pipeline/build-step/cosign-cert-verification-error.png"
alt="Cosign certificate identity validation error" 
caption="Cosign certificate identity validation error"
max-width="60%"
%}

On successful verification, `cosign` displays details about the signature, such as the digest and the base64-encoded content of the signing certificate, as in the example below.

lightbox="true"

## Examples of identity verification commands


##### Full identity verification

`cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity "https://g.codefresh.io/ilia-codefresh/sigstore-blog/keyless-signature:628a80b693a15c0f9c13ab75/6612ad6384ef42f18019b7e9" ilmedcodefresh/python-flask-sample-app:cosign-keyless-demo`.

##### Regex verification for a specific immutable account ID
Using a regex, this command verifies identities for images created by any pipeline for a specific `account-id`:  

  `cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity-regexp "https://g.codefresh.io/.*:628a80b693a15c0f9c13ab75/.*" ilmedcodefresh/python-flask-sample-app:cosign-keyless-demo`

##### Regex verification for a specific account name 
Using a regex, this command verifies identities for images created for a specific account name:  

  `cosign verify --certificate-oidc-issuer "https://oidc.codefresh.io" --certificate-identity-regexp "https://g.codefresh.io/ilia-codefresh/.*" ilmedcodefresh/python-flask-sample-app:cosign-keyless-demo`
