The **Runtimes** page displays all the runtimes deployed across your environment.  Look at the Sync Status column to quickly identify errors, if any, for runtimes. Drill down into a runtime to view its components, Git Sources, and troubleshoot sync and health issues.

### Allow insecure runtimes
If at least one of your runtimes was installed in insecure mode (without an SSL certificate from a CA), the At least one runtime was installed insecure mode alert is displayed.
{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-alert.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-alert.png" 
	alt="Insecure runtime installation alert" 
	caption="Insecure runtime installation alert"
  max-width="100%" 
%} 

All you need to do is to configure the browser to trust the URL and receive content.

1. Select **View Runtimes** to the right of the alert.  
  You are taken to the Runtimes page, where you can see insecure runtimes, tagged as **Allow Insecure**.
  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-steps.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/runtime-insecure-steps.png" 
	alt="Insecure runtimes in Runtime page" 
	caption="Insecure runtimes in Runtime page"
  max-width="40%" 
%} 
{:start="2"}
1. For each insecure runtime, select **Allow Insecure**, and when the browser prompts you to allow access, do as relevant:
  * Chrome: Click **Advanced** and then **Proceed to site**.
  * Firefox: Click **Advanced** and then **Accept the risk and continue**.
  * Safari: Click **Show Certificate**, and then select **Always allow content from localhost**.
  * Edge: Click **Advanced**, and then select **Continue to localhost(unsafe)**.

### Upgrade runtimes
Upgrade existing runtimes to install critical security updates, or the latest version of all components. An Update Available! notification in the Version column indicates that there are newer versions of the runtime, with a link to the change log.

> When there are newer versions, the Upgrade option is automatically displayed in the Runtimes page, and also when you drill down into specific runtimes. 
 
1. Make sure you are in the **Runtimes** page.
1. To see all the commits to the runtime, in the Version column, mouse over **Update Available!**, and select **View Complete Change Log**.
  
  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/change-log-popup.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/change-log-popup.png" 
	alt="Link to runtime change log" 
	caption="Link to runtime change log"
  max-width="30%" 
%} 

  Here's an example of the change log:

      {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/changelog.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/changelog.png" 
	alt="Change log" 
	caption="Change log"
  max-width="30%" 
%} 

{:start="3"}
1. On the top-right, select **Upgrade**. 
1. If you have already installed the Codefresh CLI, continue with the runtime upgrade instructions in the lower part of the Install Upgrades panel.

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/install-upgrades.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/install-upgrades.png" 
	alt="Upgrade runtime" 
	caption="Upgrade runtime"
  max-width="30%" 
%}  

### Drill down into a runtime
* Select a runtime name to see the list of runtime components, Git Sources, and their status.  

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/drilldown-on-runtime.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/drilldown-on-runtime.png" 
	alt="Runtime Components and Git Sources in runtime" 
	caption="Runtime Components and Git Sources in runtime"
  max-width="40%" 
%}


### Troubleshoot health and sync errors 
The runtime name in red, prefixed by ![](/images/runtime/icon-ExclamationCircle.png?display=inline-block) indicates either health or sync errors. 

**Health errors**  
Health errors are generated by Argo CD and by CSDP for runtime components. 


**Sync errors**  
Sync errors indicate have an **Out of sync** status in Sync Status column. They are related to discrepancies between the desired and actual state of a runtime component or one of the Git sources associated with the runtime.  

**View errors**  
Drill down into the runtime, and then select **Errors Detected**.
 


### Uninstall runtimes
You need the latest version of the CSDP CLI and a valid Git token to uninstall a runtime. 

1. Drill down into the runtime to uninstall.
1. On the top-right, select the three dots and then select ![](/images/runtime/icon-Download.png?display=inline-block) **Uninstall**.

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/uninstall-location.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/uninstall-location.png" 
	alt="Uninstall runtime option" 
	caption="Uninstall runtime option"
  max-width="40%" 
%} 

{:start="3"}
1. If you already have the latest version of the CSDP CLI, follow the instructions in the lower part of the Uninstall Codefresh Runtime panel to complete the uninstall process.

  {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/runtime/uninstall.png" 
	url="/images/runtime/uninstall.png" 
	alt="Uninstall Codefresh runtime" 
	caption="Uninstall Codefresh runtime"
  max-width="40%"
