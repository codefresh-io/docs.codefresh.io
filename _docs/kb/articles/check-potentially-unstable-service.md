This article describes how to check for a service that may be inaccessible for a number of reasons, including:
* Connectivity issues
* Connection limits
* Rate limits
* Unstable service

## How to

* In the pipline step, add the `retry` attribute, as in the following example:

```yaml
steps:
  test:
    image: ubuntu:latest
    commands:
      - api-test-here.sh
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 5
      delay: 5
      exponentialFactor: 2
```  

>**NOTE**
Every retry attempt uses up one of your concurrent builds. For this reason, we suggest limiting the amount of retries.
