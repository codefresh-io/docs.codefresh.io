## Overview

If you want to scrape the metrics from the Codefresh Runner to your existing Prometheus\Grafana stack you will need to enable the metrics in the runner engine pod.

## Details

You will need to add the `METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED: 'true'` environment variable in your Runtime Environment spec.

To make the changes in your Runtime Environment, you will need to use the [Codefresh CLI.](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/installation/)

1. Get your Runtime Environment spec:

   `codefresh get re <name> -o yaml > spec.yaml`

2. Modify\add the `envVar` section in `runtimeScheduler` in the downloaded
file:

    ```yaml  
    ...  
    runtimeScheduler:  
      envVars:  
        METRICS_PROMETHEUS_ENABLED: 'true'  
      ...  
      cluster:  
        ...
    ```

3. Save the file and then patch your RE using the following CLI command:  

  `codefresh patch re -f spec.yaml`

   Start a new build and check if you can scrape the metrics using port 9100 at the /metrics endpoint. The metrics in the dind pod should be enabled by default at the same port and endpoint.
