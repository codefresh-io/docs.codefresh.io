## Overview

When you need to uninstall the Codefresh Runner, this can be for complete removal or remove it to re-install the components due to some issue.

## Details

Items to Delete:

* Kubernetes Namespace
* Codefresh Agent / Runner
* Codefresh Runtime Environment
* Codefresh Kubernetes Integration

We will need to remove the Codefresh Runner so they do not show in the Codefresh UI. We will use the `codefresh runner delete` command [1]. Follow the prompts to remove the agent and runtime. We may need to remove some runtimes [2] from the agent if more than one is attached.

Once the command completes, we will need to delete the Kubernetes namespace for the uninstalled Runner. The reason for this as there may be lingering items, and deleting the namespace will delete everything under that namespace [3].

Once that is done, we will need to clean up items in the Codefresh UI under Account Settings. Navigate to the Codefresh Runner section to make sure the Runner is not showing. If it is showing, we can delete it from here. Next, we will navigate to the Runtime Environments. We will need to delete any lingering Runtimes from the CLI commands. Finally, we will need to go to Integrations > Kubernetes > Custom Provider and delete the added integration from the install of the Runner. The integration will show `behind firewall`.

The above will make sure that the Codefresh Runner is completely uninstalled. Also, this will make sure that you can re-install it without issues on the same Kubernetes cluster and namespace.
