This article describes how to run `npm install` from a directory other than the root.



## Option 1: Set the working directory
In your step, change the `working_directory` setting from:
{% raw %}`${{clone_step}}`{% endraw %} to {% raw %}`${{clone_step}}/subdir`{% endraw %}.

## Option 2: Change directory in step
In your step, add a command to change the directory:

```yaml
commands:   
  - cd subdir   
  - npm install
```

>**NOTE**  
Apply this logic whenever you need to use subdirectories.
