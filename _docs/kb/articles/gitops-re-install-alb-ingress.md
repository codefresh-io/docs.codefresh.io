## Pre-Installation

Install the ALB Ingress Controller.

* <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/aws-load-balancer-controller.html>
* <https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/aws-load-balancer-controller/v2.4/deploy/installation/>

Local Env Variables to set

* GIT_TOKEN - Your git provider PAT that is going to be used for the runtime
* GIT_REPO - The repo where the runtime information is going to set

## Installation

Run the following command to install the hybrid runtime with GitHub. Make sure to replace the ALL CAPS words with the correct items.

```shell
cf runtime install RUNTIME_NAME \
--provider github \
--ingress-host https://URL.COM \
--ingress-class alb \
--skip-cluster-checks \
--silent
```

The installation will mention that it has failed near the end but this is expected.

```shell
Creating a default git integration -> Failed
```

After the installation, we need to update the Ingress via Git. In the Runtime Repo, navigate to `apps/internal-router/overlays/RUNTIME_NAME/ingress.yaml` and make sure to add the following annotations.

```yaml
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/certificate-arn: ACM_CERTIFICTE_ARN
alb.ingress.kubernetes.io/actions.ssl-redirect: '{"Type": "redirect", "RedirectConfig": { "Protocol": "HTTPS", "Port": "443", "StatusCode": "HTTP_301"}}'
```

Now we need to update the workflows URL to make it work (this is optional). In the runtime repo, navigate to `apps/workflows/overlays/RUNTIME_NAME/` and create a file called `route-patch.json` with the contents below.

```json
[
  {
    "op": "add",
    "path": "/spec/template/spec/containers/0/env",
    "value": [
      {
        "name": "BASE_HREF",
        "value": "/workflows/"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

Then edit the `apps/workflows/overlays/RUNTIME_NAME/kustomization.yaml` to include the following between the namespace / resources properties.

```yaml
patches:
- path: route-patch.json
  target:
    group: apps
    kind: Deployment
    name: argo-server
    version: v1
```

Once the change has been updated in Kubernetes, we need to set the Route53 Host to point to the load balancer.

Run `kubectl get ingress -n RUNTIME_NAMESPACE` to get the ALB address

Go to Route53 and add an A Record that is an Alias to an Application and Classic Load Balancer and point to the ALB from the kubectl command. This may start with “dualstack”.

Wait a few moments for the dns records to update. If it doe snot update flush your dns on your local machine and try again. You should be able to get an OK from `https://RUNTIMEURL/app-proxy/api/healthz`

Once everything is running, add the git integration for this runtime

```shell
cf integration git add default --runtime RUNTIME_NAME --provider github --api-url https://api.github.com
```

Then register the PAT to the Runtime

```shell
cf integration git register default --runtime RUNTIME-NAME --token GIT_TOKEN
```

Once those are successful, you should be able to access the runtime without
any issues via the UI.
