## Overview

Currently, there is no way to gather this information via the Codefresh Web Interface. This information can be acquired via the CLI / API call to get the pipeline spec.

## Details

1. `codefresh get pipeline Project/Pipeline -o yaml`
2. Under spec.triggers you can see the information about each git trigger.
3. Information you will need is the **endpoint** and **secret** fields
