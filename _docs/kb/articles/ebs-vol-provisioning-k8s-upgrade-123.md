## Use case

After upgrading or creating a cluster with k8s version 1.23, the EBS volumes
can't be attached and Codefresh builds stay in pending status. There may be
the following errors in pod logs:

```shell
Warning  FailedMount 112s   kubelet  Unable to attach or mount volumes:
unmounted volumes=[dind], unattached volumes=[dind-config dind codefresh-certs-server]:
timed out waiting for the condition
```

## Solution

With k8s versions 1.23 and higher the Amazon EBS CSI driver is required for the EBS volumes management from EKS clusters, more information from AWS documentation: [Amazon EBS CSI driver](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/ebs-csi.html)

The Amazon EBS CSI driver isn't installed when you first create or update the cluster. To use the driver, you must add it as an Amazon EKS add-on or as a self-managed add-on.

* For instructions on how to add it as an Amazon EKS add-on, see [Managing the Amazon EBS CSI driver as an Amazon EKS add-on.](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eks/latest/userguide/managing-ebs-csi.html)
* For instructions on how to add it as a self-managed add-on, see the [Amazon EBS Container Storage Interface (CSI) driver project](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/aws-ebs-csi-driver) on GitHub.
