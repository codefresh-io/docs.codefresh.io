## Overview

Variable names and values get copied over each other or swapped around while editing a pipeline.

## Details

LastPass has been seen to cause this behavior when it incorrectly triggers automatic form filling based on entries for pipeline variables inside a LastPass database.

* Remove LastPass database entries related to pipeline variables.
* Consider deny listing LastPass from interacting with the Codefresh app (see below)
