## Overview

You are seeing the error "You have reached your memory usage limit" at the top of your build.

## Details

Your build has exceeded the limit of memory available to your account.

* Note that the memory is not only the tasks you are running, but what is associated with the images you are running as well.
* If running a parallel step, this can increase significantly.
  * If the error occurs at a parallel step, consider splitting it into sequential steps instead.
* If you are using particularly large Docker images, consider changing to smaller images.
* Consider upgrading to a runtime with higher memory limits.

>_Notes_ For builds on your own runner runtime, you can customize the memory limit per pipeline under Settings -> Runtime. On our SaaS offering, the standard limits are as follows:

* Small: 1 GB RAM
* Medium: 4 GB RAM
* Large: 8 GB RAM

Custom plans are available upon request.
