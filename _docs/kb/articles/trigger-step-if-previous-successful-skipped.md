## Overview

You have steps one, two, and three. You want to run step three only if steps one and two are either both successful, or both skipped.

Codefresh allows you to define complex custom condition expressions to control the flow of your steps. However, it currently only supports "all" and "any" operators for multiple expressions, not "or". So the following is not supported syntax:

```yaml
condition:
  or:
    steps_success: steps.bdd_step_1.result == 'success' || steps.bdd_step_2.result == 'success'
    steps_skipped: steps.bdd_step_1.result == 'skipped' || steps.bdd_step_2.result == 'skipped'
```

Note also that the step status "skipped" is only supported in sequential pipeline mode.

## Details

### Solution 1

This example assumes that the execution of steps one and two are controlled by some variable. You should be able to adapt this solution for most other skip conditions.

If skipping both steps one and two are controlled by a single variable, for example `SKIP`, then this set of conditions should work:

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  ...
  step-3:
      when:
        condition:
          all:
            bdd_step_1_finished: steps.bdd_step_1.result == 'success' || ${{SKIP}} == 'true'
            bdd_step_2_finished: steps.bdd_step_2.result == 'success' || ${{SKIP}} == 'true'
```

{% endraw %}

### Solution 2

If skipping these two steps is controlled by two separate flag variables `SKIPSTEP1` and `SKIPSTEP2`, then this should functionally work. Note the mismatched step to variable number in each condition - the logic might not be intuitive but it should behave the way you want:

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  ...
  step-3:
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          bdd_step_1_finished: steps.bdd_step_1.result == 'success' || ${{SKIPSTEP2}} == 'true'
          bdd_step_2_finished: steps.bdd_step_2.result == 'success' || ${{SKIPSTEP1}} == 'true'
```

{% endraw %}

The result of both of these approaches should be that step 3 will only run if either step 1 and step 2 complete successfully, or if both are skipped. Any other outcome will skip step 3.
