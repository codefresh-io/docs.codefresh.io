## Overview

You are attempting to run a multi-line inline "if" command, but it is not
processing correctly.

## Details

Multiline formatting must follow specific syntax.

We suggest that you instead include the script as a file to be downloaded as part of your Clone step, or an additional step.

If those options are not available, note:

* Do not use indentation deeper than your first command.
* Add semi-colons at the appropriate spots.

    {% raw %}

    ```yaml
      test:
        title: "Running test"
        image: "ubuntu:latest"
        commands:
          - >-
            if [ ${{VAR}} -eq 42 ];
            then 
            echo "true";
            else 
            echo "false";
            fi
    ```

    {% endraw %}

* You can concatenate everything onto one line.

>_**Note** :_ We strongly suggest making use of script files where possible. This aids with GitOps and allows easier configuration changes.
