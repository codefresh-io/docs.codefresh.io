## Overview

The Runner Runtime Environment is pre-configured with default definitions for resources (`memory` and `cpu`). Those resources are inherited from the parent Runtime Environment (RE) spec your RE is extending from.

It could be the case you want to set different defaults for the resources assigned to the builds executed in a RE.

## Details

1. Identify your RE. List your Runtime Environments so you can get the full name of the RE you would like to modify. For that purpose, execute the following command:

    ```shell
    codefresh get runtime-environments
    ```

2. Get the RE spec. Once you know the name of the RE, get its spec and store it in a file, by executing the following command:

    ```shell
    codefresh get runtime-environments <my_re_name> -o yaml > my_re.yaml
    ```

    Generally, a RE name is composed of `the_cluster_name`+`/`+`the_namespace`.

    Example: `my_cluster/codefresh-runtime`

3. Modify the `my_re.yaml` file. The default resources assigned to a build are defined in the `dockerDaemonScheduler.defaultDindResources` field of its spec. For example, to set the default `cpu` as 1 core (`1000m`) and 2 GiB of memory (`2048Mi`) your RE spec should look like this:

    ```yaml
    ...
    dockerDaemonScheduler:
      defaultDindResources:
        requests: ''
        limits:
          cpu: 1000m
          memory: 2048Mi
    ...
    ```

    > **Note 1** : this is just a snippet of the full RE spec. The rest of it is represented by "`...`". You should **not** remove the other sections of your RE spec when editing it.
    >
    > **Note 2** : by setting `requests: ''` we make sure that the container|pod where the builds will be executed, will have guaranteed resources (`requests==limits`). More information here: [What if you specify a Container's limit, but not its request?](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/cpu-default-namespace/) and here: [Pod with Guaranteed QoS](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/manage-resources/cpu-default-namespace).

    Save the changes in the file.

4. Apply the changes. Using the Codefresh CLI proceed to upload the new RE spec:

    ```shell
    codefresh patch runtime-environment <my_re_name> -f my_re.yaml
    ```

    >_**Note**:_
    >
    >* Before starting this process, it's recommended to make sure you have the latest version of the [CLI installed](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/installation/).
    >* From the configuration performed in `dockerDaemonScheduler.defaultDindResources` field it can be inferred that is possible to set `requests<limits`. While possible, it is **not recommended**. This will lead your nodes to be overcommitted, thus, your builds could eventually suffer from throttling, or just fail due to lack of resources. Having Guaranteed QoS (`requests==limits`) for the pod for your build is the recommended configuration.
