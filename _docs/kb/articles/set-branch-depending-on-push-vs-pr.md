## Overview

You want to run the same build for both push and PR events, but for PR events you need to run the build on the target branch. During a PR triggered build CF_BRANCH points to the source branch, so you can't just use the exact same variable reference for both cases.

## Details

You can set up some freestyle steps to conditionally choose either `CF_BRANCH` or `CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET`, depending on if this is a PR build or a push build. You can either export this branch name to a third variable or overwrite one of these existing branch variables, whichever is easier for your implementation.

For example, this step will overwrite the value of `CF_BRANCH` with that of `CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET`, if `CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET` exists (which would only be the case for a PR event). Then you should be able to just continue using `CF_BRANCH` in the rest of your build.

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  set_branch:
    title: "Set branch variable"
    image: "alpine:latest"
    commands:
      - cf_export CF_BRANCH=${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          whenPR: 'includes("${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}", "{{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}") == false'
```

{% endraw %}

You could also do something in a similar vein to export to a third variable instead. This example exports the branch name to a custom variable `BUILD_BRANCH` depending on whether the current build is a PR build.

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  set_push_branch:
    title: "Set branch variable for push"
    image: "alpine:latest"
    commands:
      - cf_export BUILD_BRANCH=${{CF_BRANCH}}
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          whenPR: 'includes("${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}", "{{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}") == true'
  set_pr_branch:
    title: "Set branch variable for PR"
    image: "alpine:latest"
    commands:
      - cf_export BUILD_BRANCH=${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          whenPR: 'includes("${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}", "{{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TARGET}}") == false'
```

{% endraw %}

>_Notes_ This condition works because if a variable is not set, it is simply replaced with the literal {% raw %}`${{}}`{% endraw %} variable reference string, so we are checking whether the reference is getting us the literal string or some other
actual value.

>ðŸ’¡ The ability to override predefined variables such as `CF_BRANCH` was added recently and may be disabled for your account. If the approach described in this article does not work in your account, please [contact support](https://support.codefresh.io/hc/en-us/requests/new).
