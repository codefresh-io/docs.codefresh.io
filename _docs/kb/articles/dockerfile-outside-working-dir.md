## Overview

With the build step, the 'dockerfile' parameter allows you to specify the path
to the Dockerfile. Currently the way it works, Codefresh appends the file path
to the 'working_directory' parameter. For example, when specifying an absolute
path, it will append to the 'working_directory'. The below example is trying
to access the Dockerfile at the root of my git repository.

{% raw %}

```yaml
Docker_Build:  
  title: Building docker image  
  type: build  
  stage: Build  
  working_directory: ${{Clone_Step}}/myapp  
  arguments:  
    image_name: ${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}  
    tag: main  
    dockerfile: ${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}/Dockerfile
```

{% endraw %}

The directory path of the Dockerfile will be `/codefresh/volume/myrepo/myapp/codefresh/volume/myrepo/`.

## Details

Instead of specifying the absolute path, you will need to use the special Linux directory of `../` to get outside of the working directory. In the example above, the Dockerfile was at the root of the git repository. Below is an example of how to access that directory and the Dockerfile.

{% raw %}

```yaml
Docker_Build:  
  title: Building docker image  
  type: build  
  stage: Build  
  working_directory: ${{Clone_Step}}/myapp  
  arguments:  
    image_name: ${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}  
    tag: main  
    dockerfile: ../Dockerfile
```

{% endraw %}

The directory path of the Dockerfile will technically be `/codefresh/volume/myrepo/myapp/../`, but essentially accessing the file `/codefresh/volume/myrepo/Dockerfile`. You will need to add `../` as many directories above the working directory as need to get to the directory path of Dockerfile. Also, `../mydocker/Dockerfile` is acceptable if it is in a different directory.
