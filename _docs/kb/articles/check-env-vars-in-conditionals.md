## Overview

You are trying to run a specific step only if a variable is set. You are trying to have branching logic in one pipeline.

## Details

1. Using the following syntax, you can check whether a variable exists for the current build:

   {% raw %}

    ```yaml
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          whenVarIsMissing: 'includes("${{MyVar}}", "{{MyVar}}") == true'
    ```

    {% endraw %}

2. The following syntax can be used to check for a specific value:

   {% raw %}

    ```yaml
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          whenVarValue: '"${{MyVar}}" == "myValue"'
    ```

    {% endraw %}

3. If desired, you can combine multiple checks.
