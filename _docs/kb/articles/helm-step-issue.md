## Overview

I am seeing a failure caused by the Helm step and when I look at the failure I am seeing something similar to the following:

```shell
Error: 401: unauthorized                                                                                                                                         
Error: Looks like "cm://h.cfcr.io/codefresh-example/default" is not a valid chart repository or cannot be reached: plugin "bin/helmpush" exited with error                 
Reading environment variable exporting file contents.  
[...]
```

### Workaround

If you are using the latest version of the helm step or helm step version _1.1.8_ you will need to set a fixed version in your helm steps to use version _1.1.7_. This is a known issue and is currently being looked into for a resolution.

Here is an example of the workaround:

```yaml
title: Storing Helm Chart
type: 'helm:1.1.7'
stage: test
arguments:
  action: push
  ...
```
