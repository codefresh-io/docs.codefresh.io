## Overview

Unexpected lack of access to public and/or private repositories where it was present before. An example follows:

![Missing repositories]({{site.baseurl}}/images/troubleshooting/repos-missing.png)

## Details

* There is an issue connecting to the Git provider, or
* The token used for adding Git integration is no longer valid, or lacks access

If the Git provider is currently experiencing issues, we will need to wait those out.

* If the Integration is via a user, ensure this user has the appropriate access levels.
* If the Integration is via a Token, ensure that the token is still valid and has full access.

In the event that you are not able to make these changes, you may need to create a new integration. This can be done under your account settings.
