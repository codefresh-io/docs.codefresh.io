## Issue

Freestyle step fails with message: `Failed to create a container of: <image>`

## Possible cause

This issue occurs if your image filesystem already contains a _file_ in `/codefresh` or `/codefresh volume`. The Codefresh engine cannot mount the Codefresh volume within a _file_.  

## Solution

Make sure that the filesystem does not contain files entitled `codefresh`, and that the `/codefresh/volume` directory can be created successfully.
