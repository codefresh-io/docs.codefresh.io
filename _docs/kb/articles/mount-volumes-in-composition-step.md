## Overview

Compositions steps can only mount `${{CF_VOLUME_NAME}}:${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}`, but you need to mount `/codefresh/volume/<REPO>/<DIR>/` to `/<DIR>` . This is a limitation of docker where you cannot specify a directory inside a named docker volume [1].

**Note** : this is for using a `docker-compose.yml` file in the composition step.

## Details

I have in my git rep sample data and need to mount this to the `/database` directory. My custom image is expecting data to be in `/database` to be able to run. My docker file already runs a script at startup when the container starts.

Sample `docker-compose.yml`

```yaml
version: '3.0' 
services: 
  database: 
    image: myimage:1.0.2 
    volumes: 
      - ./:/database
```

`Sample codefresh.yml`

{% raw %}

```yaml
version: 1.0

stages:
  - Clone
  - Build
  - Test

steps:

  main_clone:
    title: Cloning Repo
    type: git-clone
    stage: Clone
    arguments:
      repo: ${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}
      git: cf-support-bot
      revision: ${{CF_REVISION}}

  conform:
    title: Fix docker compose
    type: composition-editor
    stage: Build
    arguments:
      DIRECTORY: ${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}
      YAMLFILE: docker-compose.yml
      CONFORM_COMPOSITION: true
      KEYVALUE_PAIRS:
        - services.database.volumes.0=${{CF_VOLUME_NAME}}:${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}
        - services.database.command=bash -c "ln -s ${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}} /database && ./start.sh"

  composition:
    title: Running Composition
    type: composition
    stage: Test
    arguments:
      composition: docker-compose.yml
      composition_candidates:
        test_service:
          image: alpine
          command: sleep 20
          volumes:
            - ${{CF_VOLUME_NAME}}:${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}
```

{% endraw %}

In the conform step, we are replacing the volumes mount to be `${{CF_VOLUME_NAME}}:${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}`. Then add a command of `bash -c "ln -s ${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}/<DIR>/ /database && ./start.sh"` to symlink the directory in my repo to the `/database` directory and then execute my script that's already in the container. Once this is done, my composition steps will run and have the correct mounts and directories where it is needed.
