## Overview

You want to run a step only if the build is directly triggered by a webhook event, or only if it's started manually.

For example, you may have your Slack notifications set up as steps using the [Slack notifier plugin](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/slack-notifier) within your pipeline in order to get more granular control over when and how these notifications are sent, and you want to send these notifications only if the build is automatically started via webhook, not when the build is manually
triggered.

## Details

To execute a step only when a build is manually triggered, you can create a condition to check for the value of the [system-provided variable]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#system-provided-variables) `CF_BUILD_TRIGGER`. This variable's value will be `webhook` if the build was started by a webhook event, and `build` if it was started manually (through UI, CLI, or API).

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  SendToSlack:
    type: slack-notifier
    arguments:
      SLACK_HOOK_URL: '${{SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL}}'
      SLACK_TEXT: '${{SLACK_TEXT}}'
      SLACK_ATTACHMENTS: '${{SLACK_ATTACHMENTS}}'
  when:
    condition:
      all:
        webhookTriggered: '"${{CF_BUILD_TRIGGER}}" == "webhook"'
```

{% endraw %}

Similarly, you can match for the value `build` if you want to execute a step only if the build is manually initiated.

In child builds started with codefresh run, the value of `CF_BUILD_TRIGGER` will always be `build`. This is because although the parent build may be webhook-triggered, the child build is always started via API, which counts as a "manual" start.

To get around this, you can explicitly pass this variable from the parent to the child build to override the default value.

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  run_child_pipeline:
    type: codefresh-run  
    arguments:
      ...
      VARIABLE:
        - CF_BUILD_TRIGGER=${{CF_BUILD_TRIGGER}}
```

{% endraw %}
