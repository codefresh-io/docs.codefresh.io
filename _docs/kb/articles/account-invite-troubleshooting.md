## Overview

1. Accepting an invite does not allow you to access the inviting account.
1. Accepting an invite does not work and fails to let you log in.
1. Accepting an invite requires you to create an Organization.

## Details

1. For your security and to ensure a smooth process, it's crucial that the email account you're logging in with is the same as the email address used for the invite.
1. Log out of any previous sessions with the relevant identity provider and, if necessary, try a different browser or a private/incognito window.
1. If you can log in but need help finding the inviting account, your user may be under multiple accounts. If this is the case, you can switch between available accounts via the user menu drop-down in the upper right-hand corner.
