## Overview

While using AWS ECR as your container registry when using a push step in pipeline it's failing with "Failed to get registry credentials" error

## Details

Incorrect push step syntax.

Use example below as a reference:

{% raw %}

```yaml
push_image_ECR:
  title: Pushing image to ECR
  region: '${{AWS_REGION}}'
  accessKeyId: '${{AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID}}'
  secretAccessKey: '${{AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}}'
  type: push
  stage: push
  provider: ecr
  image_name: '${{IMAGE_NAME}}'
  candidate: '${{build_step_name}}'
  tag: '${{CF_BRANCH}}'
```

{% endraw %}

> **_Note_**
>
>This example assumes you're using `provider` name as set in Integrations, not the `registry` logical name.
