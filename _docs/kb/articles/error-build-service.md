## Overview

When attempting to start a build manually, an error appears: **Error building service when running pipeline**

## Details

A connection to the appropriate repository or YAML file cannot be made, or there is an error in the YAML syntax.

* If you are [using a legacy pipeline that references a Personal Git Provider]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/kb/articles/personal-git-deprecation/), this is prone to happen.
  * This requires actions from Codefresh support to resolve. Please contact us by opening a support ticket and providing a link to the affected pipelines.
* If using pipeline YAML from repository with an "Auto-Select Branch":
  * If build is triggered manually, ensure you select a trigger that is associated to the Git repo containing this pipeline YAML.
    * Codefresh needs the information provided through a trigger to determine which branch to pull the pipeline YAML from.
  * Ensure that the branch you are using has the associated YAML.
* If using in-line YAML:
  * Fix any errors indicated in the YAML editor.
  * If no errors appear, ensure that any steps referenced exist. For example, if you have `working_dir` set to {% raw %}`${{colne}}`{% endraw %} instead of {% raw %}`${{clone}}`{% endraw %}, this error can appear.

>_Notes_ If this still does not work, please open a ticket and include a link to the pipeline(s).
