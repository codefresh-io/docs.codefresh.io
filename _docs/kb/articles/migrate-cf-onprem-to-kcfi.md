## Overview

Since cf-onprem script is getting deprecated you might want to start using our
brand new kcfi installer for upgrades of your existing codefresh onprem
installation

## Details

First of all you need to install kcfi from this repo
<https://github.com/codefresh-io/kcfi>

1. Download the latest release here: <https://github.com/codefresh-io/kcfi/releases>
2. Extract the file you just downloaded. Copy the file to your $PATH, i.e. cp /path/to/kcfi /usr/local/bin
3. Run the following `kcfi init codefresh [-d /path/to/stage-dir]`. It will create the directory containing a `config.yaml`

4. Replace the `config.yaml` contents with the following:

    ```yaml
    
    metadata:
      kind: codefresh
      installer:
        type: helm
        helm:
          chart: codefresh
          repoUrl: http://charts.codefresh.io/prod
          #version:
    
    kubernetes:
      namespace: codefresh
    
    images:
      codefreshRegistrySa: sa.json
      lists:
      - images/images-list
    
    ### <-------
    ```

    Copy and paste your existing `values.yaml` file contents to the end of thex`config.yaml`

5. Copy your `sa.json` file to the same directory with the `config.yaml`
6. In case you want to upgrade your existing codefresh onprem installation to the latest version just select the context in `kubectl` and run `kcfi deploy -c /path/to/config.yaml`

>_Notes_  
>Specific Codefresh on-premise version can be installed by uncommenting `metadata.installer.helm.version` and providing the version you wish to install as a value
