## Overview

The Parent-Child approach is a common pattern when defining your CI/CD processes. It's possible to implement that model in Codefresh when using the `codefresh-run` plugin ([link](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/codefresh-run)).

Given the popularity of this pattern, it's also common having to navigate from the Parent-build to its Child-build. This functionality is natively provided by the platform.

But, currently, it's not possible to easily navigate from the Child-build to its parent.

In this article we'll provide a solution for that scenario.

## Details

Every build that is executed by a call to a `codefresh-run` plugin is enriched with a special annotation that precisely identifies its parent.

The name of this annotation is `cf_predecessor`. We can query the value of this annotation in the Child-build, and using that information we can know its parent. Specifically, it's possible to get the ID of the Parent-build.

With that information, it's also possible to build a link to the Parent-build by constructing the corresponding build-URL.

### Implementation

Since all the information can be inferred from the Child-build itself, there's nothing to add or modify in the Parent-build.

You'll need to simply add this step to the Child-build. For example, at the beginning of the pipeline:

{% raw %}

```yaml
    steps:
      ...
      linkToParentBuild:
        image: codefresh/cli
        commands:
          - export parentBuildId=$(codefresh get annotation build ${{CF_BUILD_ID}} cf_predecessor -o json | jq -r '.value')
          - cf_export linkToParentBuild_CF_OUTPUT_URL="${{CF_URL}}/build/${parentBuildId}"
      ...
```

{% endraw %}

> Note:
>
> For the in-step-link to work, the name of the `cf_export`ed variable must follow this pattern: `<name|key_of_step>_CF_OUTPUT_URL`, and its value should be the URL to link to.
