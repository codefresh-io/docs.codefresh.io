## Overview

You want to run a step in your pipeline, only if a certain file exists

## Details

1. Clone your repository
2. After the clone step, check for existence of file.
3. If it exists, set your Variable to true. Otherwise, set it to false.
4. In the appropriate step, check whether the variable is true or not.

{% raw %}

```yaml
steps:
  main_clone:
    type: git-clone
    description: Cloning main repository...
    repo: ${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}
    revision: '${{CF_REVISION}}'
  checkFile:
    image: alpine
    commands:
      - if [ -f README.md ]; then cf_export fileExists=true; else cf_export fileExists=false; fi
  confirmFile:
    image: alpine
    commands: 
      - echo $fileExists
    when:
      condition:
        all:
          fileExists: '"${{fileExists}}" == "true"'
```

{% endraw %}

>You can use this to also check if a file is missing, or to perform similar more complicated checks and create a flow for your pipelines.
