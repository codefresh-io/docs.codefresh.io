  service.beta.kubernetes.io/aws-load-balancer-ssl-cert: arn:aws:acm:REGION:ACCOUNTID:certificate/CERTIFICATEID
  ```

* Apply the yaml to your cluster

  ```shel
  kubectl apply -f deploy.yaml
  ```

### Update Route 53

Get the External Address (Load Balancer) of the Ingress Controller

```shell
kubectl get service -n ingress-nginx ingress-nginx-controller
```

In Route 53 create an Host for GitOps Runtime

  1. Create a new Record
  2. Record Name to be your subdomain
  3. For Value toggle the Alias
  4. Alias for Network Load Balancer > REGION > Select the external Address from above

### Install the Runtime

Verify that you can reach the Ingress Controller with the host name you created (will return 404)

Run the following to install the runtime

```shell
cf runtime install MY-RUNTIME \  
--ingress-host https://HOSTNAME \  
--ingress-class nginx \  
--silent
```
