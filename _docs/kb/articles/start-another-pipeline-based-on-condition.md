## Overview

As part of your pipeline, you want to start another pipeline based on condition.

For example, you want to start child pipeline when one of the step fails.

## Details

Use the example below:

```yaml
run_tests:
    image: alpine:latest
    title: Run tests which could fail
    fail_fast: false #allow pipeline to keep running even if this step fails 
    commands:
      - exit 1 #simulate test fail

run_pipeline:
  image: codefresh/cli
  title: Run pipeline
  commands:
    - codefresh run $PIPELINE_ID -t=$TRIGGER_NAME -b=master
  when:
    condition:
      all:
        myCondition: run_tests.result == 'failure'
```
