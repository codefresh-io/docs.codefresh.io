## Overview

When trying to perform an action on your selected Kubernetes context (such as installing a new Codefresh runner), you get the following error:

```shell
Kubeconfig user entry is using an invalid API version client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1.
```

## Details

Since [kubectl 1.24.0](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/CHANGELOG/CHANGELOG-1.24.md#deprecation), the client.authentication.k8s.io/v1alpha1 api has been removed. Your installed kubectl binary is probably at an older version, so it can connect to your contexts without an issue. Our cli tool is using an updated version of the Kubernetes client, and so it can not parse your KUBECONFIG file. Make sure you are running the latest CLI tool for your cloud provider and rerun the KUBECONFIG generation command for the deprecated contexts. For example if you are using aws run `aws eks update-kubeconfig â€“name CLUSTER_NAME`.
