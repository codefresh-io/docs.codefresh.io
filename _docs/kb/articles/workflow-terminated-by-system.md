## Issue

Workflow process terminated by the system

## Possible cause

If you have a long workflow that takes more than several minutes to finish, it can be automatically terminated by the system. As when there isn't any update in the build process logs after more than 45 minutes.  

By default, the system terminates a build step that seems "inactive" after 45 minutes. If your step does not print anything in the log for 45 minutes, it is considered inactive.

## Solution

You can choose one of the following suggestions to resolve it:

- Review your Dockerfile and steps of your workflow to decrease the time needed to execute the workflow.
- Move to the dedicated infrastructure configuration (Codefresh on-premises version).
- Add an additional log to the process (see below for an example).
- Contact us to talk about startup pricing.

{{site.data.callout.callout_warning}}
If your workflow process has been terminated by the system for another reason that is not listed here, please let us know.
{{site.data.callout.end}}

As an example, if you have a long running process that takes more than 45 minutes you can try adding a command that echoes something every 10 minutes to STDOUT before your command, like this:

```yaml
SlowFreeStyleStep:
  title: Performing a slow process
  image: my-docker-image:1.0
  commands:
    - /bin/bash -c "while true; do echo Keep alive... && sleep 600; done &"
    - ./my-really-slow-script.sh
```
