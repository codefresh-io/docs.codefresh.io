Variables in the YAML follow this format: {% raw %}`${{VAR_NAME}}`{% endraw %}.
The flow provides three forms of variable substitution:
- system provided: substituted during the workflow compilation phase.
- context related: substituted in real time during the workflow execution.
- custom user provided: created and substituted in real time during the workflow execution

## System Provided Variables

All system provided variables will also be automatically injected to any freestyle step.

| Any variable specified in the pipeline settings   | For example, if you configure the pipeline settings with a variable named PORT, you can put the variable in your YAML build descriptor as {% raw %}`${{PORT}}`{% endraw %}.                                                                                                                                              |

## Context Related Variables
Context related variables are created dynamically during the workflow execution and according to the used steps.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Variable                                          | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Working Directories**                           | For example, you can set the working directory of step `A` with a variable named after a previously executed step, step `B`. Therefore, setting step `A` with {% raw %}`working-directory:${{B}}`{% endraw %} means that step `A` executes in the same working directory as step `B`.                |
| **Images**                                        | You can set the candidate field of the push step with a variable named after a previously executed build step. Since the details of a created image are not necessarily known ahead of time, the variable can create an association to an optionally dynamic image name. Therefore, setting push step `A` with {% raw %}`candidate:${{B}}`{% endraw %} means that step `A` will push the image build buy step `B`.                |

## Github Release Variables

Github allows you to create [releases](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-releases/) for marking specific git tags for general availability.

You can set a [trigger]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/triggers/git-triggers/) for Github releases. When a Github release happens the following variables are also available:



{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Variable        | Description                                            |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_RELEASE_NAME}}`{% endraw %}     | Github release title   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_RELEASE_TAG}}`{% endraw %}      | GIT tag version   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_RELEASE_ID}}`{% endraw %}       | Internal ID for this release   |
| {% raw %}`${{CF_PRERELEASE_FLAG}}`{% endraw %}  | true if the release if marked as non-production ready, false if it is ready for production   |

## User Provided Variables

User provided variables can be defined at 4 levels:
1. Freestyle step definition: using the `environment` field.
1. Pipeline execution: after clicking the "Build" button, open the "Advanced options" section.
1. Pipeline definition: under "Environment variables" section in the pipeline view.
1. Shared Configuration: defined under your account settings, and used using the "Import from shared configuration" button under the "Environment Variables" section in the pipeline view.

The options are listed in order of importance, so in case of multiple variables defined at different location with the same name, the order of overriding will be as listed here.

## Exporting environment variables from a freestyle step

Steps defined inside steps are scoped to the step they were created in (even if you used the `export` command). In order to allow using variables across steps, we provide a shared file that facilitates variables importing and exporting. There are two ways to add variables to this file:

### Using cf_export command
Inside every freestyle step there's a command called `cf_export` that allows you to export variables across steps (by writing to the shared variables file).

You can either:
- explicitly state a VAR=VAL pair  
- state the name of an existing environment variable (like EXISTING_VAR).

{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  freestyle-step-1:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      - cf_export VAR1=VALUE1 VAR2=VALUE2 EXISTING_VAR

  freestyle-step-2:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling 2
    image: {% raw %}${{VAR1}}{% endraw %}
    commands:
      - echo $VAR2
      - curl http://$EXISTING_VAR/index.php
{% endhighlight %}
 
### Directly writing to the file

For more advanced use cases, you can write directly to the shared file.

The variables file will be availble inside the freestyle container in the following path: **`{% raw %}${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}{% endraw %}/env_vars_to_export`** 

{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  freestyle-step-1:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      - echo VAR1=192.168.0.1 >> {% raw %}${{CF_VOLUME_PATH}}{% endraw %}/env_vars_to_export
          
  freestyle-step-2:
    description: Freestyle step..
    title: Free styling 2
    image: {% raw %}${{hey}}{% endraw %}
    commands:
      - curl http://$VAR1/index.php
{% endhighlight %}

## Escape Characters
When passing special characters through environmental variables `\` can be used as an escape character. For example if you were passing a cassandra connection string you might do something like `Points\=hostname\;Port\=16376\;Username\=user\;Password\=password`

This will safely escape `;` and `=`.
