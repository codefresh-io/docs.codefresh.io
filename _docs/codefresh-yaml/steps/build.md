Use Docker to build an image and store it in Codefresh.

## Purpose of build steps

In Codefresh, docker containers are first-class citizens
and special typed steps are offered for the most usual docker commands. Build steps are a secure replacement for `docker build` commands.

Therefore, this command on your local workstation:

```
docker build . -t my-app-image:1.0.1
```

will become in Codefresh the following build step.

```yaml
BuildMyImage:
  title: Building My Docker image
  type: build
  image_name: my-app-image
  tag: 1.0.1
```

## Usage

## Examples

Build an image using a Dockerfile in the root project folder:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
{% endhighlight %}

Build an image using a different Dockerfile and a specific version tag

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    dockerfile: my-custom.Dockerfile
    tag: 1.0.1
{% endhighlight %}

Build an image using a different Dockerfile and push multiple tags to the default registry.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    dockerfile: my-custom.Dockerfile
    tags:
      - latest
      - ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED_LOWER_CASE}}
      - v1.1
{% endraw %}        
{% endhighlight %}

Build an image and automatotically push to the [registry]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/external-docker-registries/) with name `my-registry`.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    dockerfile: my-custom.Dockerfile
    tag: 1.0.1
    registry: my-registry
{% endhighlight %}

Build two images in two different folders using [Codefresh variables]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/) as tags.

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildNodeImage:
    title: Building My Node app
    type: build    
    image_name: my-department/my-team/my-node-image
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    working_directory: ./project1
    tag: ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}-${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}
  BuildGoImage:
    title: Building My Go app
    type: build    
    image_name: my-company/my-go-image
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    working_directory: ./project2
    tag: ${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED_LOWER_CASE}}
{% endraw %}         
{% endhighlight %}

It also possible to build Docker images in [parallel]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/advanced-workflows/) for faster builds.

### Inline Dockerfile

If your project does not already have a Dockerfile, you can also define one within the pipeline:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildingDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-own-go-app
    working_directory: ./
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}'
    dockerfile:
      content: |-
       # ---
       # Go Builder Image
       FROM golang:1.8-alpine AS builder
       # set build arguments: GitHub user and repository
       ARG GH_USER
       ARG GH_REPO
       # Create and set working directory
       RUN mkdir -p /go/src/github.com/$GH_USER/$GH_REPO
       # copy file from builder image
       COPY --from=builder /go/src/github.com/$GH_USER/$GH_REPO/dist/myapp
       /usr/bin/myapp
       CMD ["myapp", "--help"]
{% endraw %}         
{% endhighlight %}

Use this technique only as a last resort. It is better if the Dockerfile exists as an actual file in source control.


## Automatic pushing

All images built successfully with the build step, will be automatically pushed to the default Docker registry in your account. This behavior is completely automatic and happens without any extra configuration on your part. If you want to disable this then add the `disable_push` property in your build step.

>Notice that the [push step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/push/) in Codefresh is optional and is only needed if you want to push to [external Docker registries]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/external-docker-registries/). 

{% 
  include image.html 
  lightbox="true" 
  file="/images/artifacts/cfcr/codefresh-registry-list.png" 
  url="/images/artifacts/cfcr/codefresh-registry-list.png" 
  alt="Docker Images pushed automatically" 
  caption="Docker Images pushed automatically" 
  max-width="80%" 
%}

## Buildkit support

Codefresh also allows you to use [buildkit](https://github.com/moby/buildkit) with all its [enhancements](https://docs.docker.com/develop/develop-images/build_enhancements/) and [experimental features](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md#experimental-syntaxes).

Using buildkit you can get:

* Improved build output logs
* Mounting of external secrets that will never be stored in the image
* Access to SSH keys and sockets from within the Dockerfile
* Use cache and bind-mounts at build time

These capabilities are offered as extra arguments in the build step and using any of them will automatically enable buildkit. You can utilize the different mount-options for the Dockerfile instruction `RUN` as long as buildkit is enabled for your build step. Mounts of type [`cache`](https://github.com/moby/buildkit/blob/master/frontend/dockerfile/docs/experimental.md#example-cache-go-packages) work out of the box and are persisted between pipeline runs.

The simplest way to use buildkit is by enabling it explicitly:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    buildkit: true
{% endhighlight %}

Buildkit is also automatically enabled if you use any of its features such as the `progress` property:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    progress: tty
{% endhighlight %}

Possible values for `progress` are `tty` and `plain`. 

For secrets you can either mention them in a single line:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    secrets:
      - id=secret1,src=./my-secret-file1.txt
      - id=secret2,src=./my-secret-file2.txt
{% endhighlight %}

or multiple lines:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    secrets:
      - id: secret1
        src: ./my-secret-file1.txt
      - id: secret2
        src: ./my-secret-file2.txt
{% endhighlight %}

For the SSH connection you can either use the default:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    ssh: default
{% endhighlight %}


or define different keys:

`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    ssh:
      - github=~/.ssh/github_rsa
      - bitbucket=~/.ssh/bitbucket_rsa
{% endhighlight %}

You might want to use an environment variable to store and retrieve a ssh key. This can be achieved by converting you ssh key into a one-line string:
```
tr '\n' ',' < /path/to/id_rsa
```

Copy the output and place it an [environment variable]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/#user-provided-variables). To make the SSH key availabe to the build step, you can write it to the codefresh volume:
`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  SetupSshKeys:
    title: Setting up ssh key
    image: alpine:latest
    commands:
      - mkdir /codefresh/volume/keys
      - echo "${SSH_KEY}" | tr  ',' '\n' > /codefresh/volume/keys/github_rsa

  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    image_name: my-app-image
    type: build
    tag: latest
    ssh:
      - github=/codefresh/volume/keys/github_rsa
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


You can combine all options (`ssh`, `progress`, `secrets`) in a single build step if desired.
