With Codefresh you can [create really complex pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/pipelines/) with any number of steps. To better visualize the pipeline, you can group several steps into a single _stage_ that will show up as a separate column in the [pipeline view]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/monitoring-pipelines/).

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/complex-pipeline.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/complex-pipeline.png"
alt="Complex pipeline" 
caption="Complex pipeline"
max-width="70%"
%}

In this example there are 4 pipeline stages.

## Assigning steps to a stage.

Stages are completely optional and for really small pipelines they are not needed at all.
By default, all pipeline steps are shown one after the other.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/linear-view.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/linear-view.png"
alt="Default pipeline view" 
caption="Default pipeline view"
max-width="50%"
%}

This view works ok for small pipelines, but for a big number of steps it is better to group them into pipeline *stages* like shown below:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/example.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/example.png"
alt="Different pipeline stages" 
caption="Different pipeline stages"
max-width="80%"
%}

The number of stages (i.e columns) and their titles is completely configurable. 
To enable this view, you need to make two modifications at the `codefresh.yml` file:

Here is the skeleton:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
 - [stage-name-1]
 - [stage-name-2]

steps:
  step-name:
    [step-contents]
    stage: [name-of-stage]
  another-step:
    [step-contents]
    stage: [name-of-stage]
  the-very-last-step:
    [step-contents]
    stage: [name-of-stage]
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the modifications needed are:

1. To list all the stage names at the root of the pipeline file 
1. To use the `stage` property on each step to assign it to a stage

>This updated pipeline view is only a nice way to visualize the pipeline. It does not affect the order of step execution. Steps will still execute in the same order listed in the `codefresh.yml` file. If you wish to use parallel execution and advanced workflows see the [parallel steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/advanced-workflows/) page.


## Example pipeline with several stages

Here is a more concrete example that you can use as a starting point:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
 - prepare
 - test
 - build
 - scan
 - integration
 - deploy
steps:
    step1:
        stage: 'prepare'
        image: node
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 1!"'
    step2:
       image: node
       stage: 'prepare'
       commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 2!"'
    step3:
        image: node
        stage: 'test'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 3!"'
    step4:
        image: node
        stage: 'build'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 4!"'
    step5:
        image: node
        stage: 'scan'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 5!"'
    step6:
        image: node
        stage: 'scan'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 6!"'
    step7:
        image: node
        stage: 'integration'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 7!"'        
    step8:
        image: node
        stage: 'deploy'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 8!"'    
    step9:
        image: node
        stage: 'deploy'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 9!"'
{% endraw %}                
{% endhighlight %}

If you run the pipeline you will see this view

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/complex.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/stages/complex.png"
alt="Complex Pipeline view" 
caption="Complex Pipeline view"
max-width="80%"
%}

Remember that the assignment of a step to a stage is happening only for graphical grouping purposes. It does
not affect the way your steps run. All steps will still run in the same order mentioned in the `codefresh.yml` file.

Also notice if you enable this view a stage called *default* will show all build steps that are not explicitly assigned to a stage.

## Using spaces in stage names

If you wish to have spaces in stage names you need to quote them like this:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
- 'my build phase'
- 'my test phase'
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    stage: 'my build phase'
    type: build
    image_name: my-app
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Unit testing
    stage: 'my test phase'
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    commands: 
    - npm run test
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
