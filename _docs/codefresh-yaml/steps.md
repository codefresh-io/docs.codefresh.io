Codefresh [pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/) are composed of a series of steps. 

You can create your own pipelines by writing a  [codefresh.yml]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) file that describes your pipeline. This file can then be version controlled on its own (pipeline as code).

## Built-in steps

The steps offered by Codefresh are:

* [Git clone]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/git-clone/)
* [Freestyle]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/)
* [Build]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/build/)
* [Push]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/push/)
* [Composition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/composition/)
* [Launch test environment]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/launch-composition/)
* [Deploy]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/deploy/)
* [Approval]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/approval/)

**Git clone** steps allow you to checkout code in your pipeline from any internal or external repository. Existing accounts that still use repositories instead of [projects]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/pipelines/#pipeline-concepts) have an implicit clone step in the pipelines. 

**Freestyle** steps are the cornerstone of Codefresh pipelines. They allow you to run any command within the context of a Docker container. A lot of Codefresh optimizations such as the [shared docker volume]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/#sharing-the-workspace-between-build-steps) are designed specifically for freestyle steps.
Freestyle steps are a secure replacement for `docker run` commands.

**Build** steps are the main way where you get access to the Docker daemon (Docker as a service) in Codefresh pipelines. Build steps take as input any Dockerfile and run it on the cloud in a similar manner to what you do on your workstation. Build steps automatically push the result to the default Docker registry of your account (no need for docker login commands). Codefresh also comes with a global Docker cache that automatically gets attached to all build nodes. Build steps are a secure replacement for `docker build` commands.

**Push** steps allow you to push and tag your docker images (created by the build step) in any [external Docker registry]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/external-docker-registries/). Push steps are *not* needed at all if you work with only the internal Codefresh registry. Push steps are a secure replacement for the `docker tag` and `docker push` commands.

**Composition** steps allow you to run multiple services together in the Codefresh infrastructure and execute unit tests or other commands against them. They are discarded once a pipeline finishes. Composition steps are a secure replacement for `docker-compose` definitions.

**Launch test environment** steps behave similar to compositions, but they persist after the pipeline ends. This is a great way to create preview environment from your pull requests and send to colleagues.

**Deploy steps** allow you to [perform Kubernetes deployments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy-to-kubernetes/deployment-options-to-kubernetes/) in a declarative manner. They embody the Continuous Deployment aspect of Codefresh.

**Approval steps** allow you to pause pipelines and wait for human intervention before resuming. They allow you to embrace the concepts of Continuous Delivery.

>Note that Codefresh also supports [parallel workflows]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/advanced-workflows/) as well as running pipelines [locally on your workstation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/running-pipelines-locally/).

## Step directory

In the case of freestyle steps we also offer a [plugin marketplace](https://codefresh.io/steps/) with several existing plugins for popular integrations.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/plugin-directory.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/plugin-directory.png"
alt="Codefresh steps directory" 
caption="Codefresh steps directory" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

Codefresh steps can be:

* Private (visible only to you and your team) or public (visible to everybody via the marketplace)
* Official (supported by the Codefresh team) or community based
* Ready for production or still incubating.

You can use any your pipelines any of the public steps already in the marketplace, any steps created by your team and any steps that you create for yourself.

## Using custom pipeline steps

When you create a pipeline, you will have access to two categories of steps:

* Public steps that exist in the marketplace
* Steps that you or your team have created (visible only to you)

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/choose-step.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/choose-step.png"
alt="Choosing a custom step" 
caption="Choosing a custom step" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

To use a step, first click on the pipeline section where you want to insert the step.
You will get a new dialog with all the details of the step along with a live preview of the exact
[yaml]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/what-is-the-codefresh-yaml/) that will be inserted in your pipeline.

For all steps you can define:

* The title of the text (which will also be visible in the pipeline UI)
* A freetext description 
* The [stage]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/stages/) that will contain the step

The rest of the fields are specific to each step. See the documentation of each step in order to understand what each field should contain. There are fields for each step that are marked as required and are essential for the step to work. These are marked with an asterisk.

Once a step is added to the pipeline, you are fee to change the resulting yaml even further by just typing in the pipeline editor.

## Creating your own step

There are two ways to create custom steps in Codefresh. The simplest way is to package an existing CLI tool into a Docker image and use it as a freestyle step. The more advanced way is creating a typed step with explicit input and output parameters.

Here is a summary on the two ways:

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
|           | Custom freestyle step                 | Codefresh typed plugin  |
| -------------- | ---------------------------- |-------------------------|
| Assets needed       | A Docker image | A Docker image and a plugin manifest|
| Knowledge required  | Docker building/pushing | Docker and Codefresh CLI  |
| Step can be used        | In any Docker based CI/CD platform | In Codefresh |
| Effort required   | Minimal | Medium |
| Distribution via  | Dockerhub | Codefresh marketplace |
| Input variables   | Yes | Yes|
| Output variables   | No | Yes |
| Versioning via | Docker tags | Manifest entry |
| Grouping of multiple steps | No | Yes |
| Marketplace entry | Not possible| Possible/optional |
| Best for sharing steps |  with your team/company | with the world |



We suggest that you start with custom freestyle steps first and only create typed plugins once you are familiar with Codefresh pipelines or want your plugin to appear in the marketplace.


### Creating a custom freestyle step

As an example let's say that you need to use the [JFrog CLI](https://jfrog.com/getcli/) in a pipeline in order to interact with a Artifactory or Bintray. JFrog does not offer any Docker image that contains the CLI and you already know that all Codefresh steps [are actually Docker images]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/).

Therefore you can easily package the CLI into a Docker image and then make it available to any Codefresh pipeline that wishes to use it.
First you create [a Dockerfile](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/jfrog-cli-wrapper/Dockerfile) that packages the CLI

 `Dockerfile`
{% highlight docker %}
{% raw %}
FROM debian:stable-slim

WORKDIR /jfrog-cli

ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive

RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y curl && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* 

RUN curl -fL https://getcli.jfrog.io | sh

ENV JFROG_CLI_OFFER_CONFIG false
ENV BINTRAY_LICENCES MIT

RUN /jfrog-cli/jfrog bt config --licenses $BINTRAY_LICENCES

RUN ln -s /jfrog-cli/jfrog /usr/local/bin/jfrog

CMD ["/jfrog-cli/jfrog"]
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a standard Dockerfile. There is nothing specific to Codefresh in the image that gets created. You can test this Dockerfile locally with 

{% highlight shell %}
{% raw %}
docker build . -t jfrog-cli
docker run jfrog-cli
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

In a similar manner you can package any other executable and its dependencies. You could even just package `curl` with an external URL that hosts the service that you want to interact in a Codefresh pipeline.

Once the Dockerfile is ready, you need to push it to Dockerhub. You can either do it manually from your workstation, but it is best if you actually create a [Codefresh pipeline](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/jfrog-cli-wrapper/codefresh.yml) that does it for you.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/create-custom-step.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/create-custom-step.png"
alt="Creating a custom freestyle step" 
caption="Creating a custom freestyle step" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

Now that the image is ready and public you can notify your team that the new plugin is ready.
Everybody who wants to interact with JFrog Bintray and/or Artifactory can place [the following snippet](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/jfrog-cli-wrapper/codefresh-example.yml) in a pipeline:

 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  run_frog_cli:
    title: Running jfrog CLI inside Docker
    image: kkapelon/jfrog-cli
    commands:
      - jfrog bt --help
      - jfrog rt --help
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can then customize the exact command(s) that you want to run with the tool. All capabilities of freestyle steps are possible, such as passing environment variables as input parameters.

 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  run_frog_cli:
    title: Running jfrog CLI inside Docker
    image: kkapelon/jfrog-cli
    commands:
      - jfrog bt package-show google/tensorflow/tensorflow
    environment:
      - BINTRAY_USER=my-user
      - BINTRAY_KEY=my-secret-key
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to use multiple versions of the step in the same pipeline, you can just create different docker tags. Notice  that you can also use a [private registry]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/external-docker-registries/) instead of Dockerhub if you wish your step to be used only within your organization. 



### Creating a typed Codefresh plugin

You can use the [Codefresh CLI](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/) and more specifically the [step-type resource](https://codefresh-io.github.io/cli/steps/) to create your own typed step. Each Codefresh step is composed from two parts:

1. The step description in the special yaml syntax for describing Codefresh steps
1. A Docker image that implements the step (optional)

The easiest way to create your own step is to start by using the definition of an existing step.

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh get step-type vault -o yaml > vault-step.yml
{% endhighlight %}

Here is the resulting yaml:

  `vault-step.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
kind: step-type
metadata:
  name: <codefresh_account_name>/<step_name>
  isPublic: true

            },
            "VAULT_CLIENT_KEY_BASE64": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "Base64 encoded client key"
            }
        }
    }
  steps:
    main:
      name: vault
      image: codefreshplugins/vault
      environment:
        - 'VAULT_ADDR=${{VAULT_ADDR}}'
        - 'VAULT_PATH=${{VAULT_PATH}}'
        - 'VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN=${{VAULT_AUTH_TOKEN}}'
        - 'VAULT_CLIENT_CERT_BASE64=${{VAULT_CLIENT_CERT_BASE64}}'
        - 'VAULT_CLIENT_KEY_BASE64=${{VAULT_CLIENT_KEY_BASE64}}'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For each step you define the following sections:

* Metadata to describe the characteristics of the step
* The description of its arguments
* The implementation (i.e. what yaml gets inserted in the pipeline)

For the metadata section note the following:

* `isPublic` decides if this step is visible only to your and your team, or visible to all (in the marketplace)
* The `name` of the step **must** be prefixed with your Codefresh account name. Steps created by the Codefresh team are on the root level of the hierarchy (without prefix). This is the same pattern that Dockerhub is using for images.
* `stage` shown if this step is ready for production or still incubating. This is just an indication to users. It doesn't affect the implementation of the step in any way
* `icon`. Ideally you provide a transparent svg so that the icon is scalable. The icon for a step is used both in the marketplace as well as the pipeline view. You can also select a default background to be used. Alternatively, you can define jpg/png icons for large/medium/small sizes. We suggest the svg approach
* The `version` property allows you to update your plugin and keep multiple variants of it in the marketplace
* The `examples` section will be shown in the marketplace as documentation for your step

For the argument section we follow the [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples.html). You can use the [Schema generator](https://jsonschema.net/) to easily create a schema. JSON schema is used for arguments (i.e. input parameters) as well as output parameters as we will see later on.

The property `additionalProperties` defines how strict the plugin will be with its arguments. If you set it to `false` (which is usually what you want) the pipeline will fail if the plugin is given more arguments that it is expecting. If you set it to `true`, then the plugin will only use the arguments it understands and will ignore the rest.

The final part is the step implementation. Here you can define exactly the yaml that this step will insert in the pipeline. You can use any of the built-in steps in Codefresh and even add multiple steps.

>Note that currently you cannot nest custom pipeline steps. We are aware of this limitation and are actively working on it, but at the time or writing you cannot use a typed step inside another typed step.

Once you are done with your step, use the Codefresh CLI to upload it to the marketplace. If you want the step to be available only to you and your team make sure that the property `isPublic` is false (and then it will not be shown in the marketplace).

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh create step-type -f my-custom-step.yml
{% endhighlight %}

If you make further changes to your step you can update it:

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh replace step-type -f my-custom-step.yml
{% endhighlight %}

If you want to remove your step from the marketplace, you can delete it completely:

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh delete step-type kostis-codefresh/sample
{% endhighlight %}

### Versioning of typed steps

The `version` property under `metadata` in the plugin manifest allows you to publish multiple releases of the same plugin in the marketplace. Codefresh will keep all previous plugins and users are free to choose which version they want.

To create a new version of your plugin:

1. Update the `version` property under `metadata` in your custom YAML.
2. Run: 

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh create step-type -f custom-plugin.yaml
{% endhighlight %}

You will now be able to see the new versions of your plugin in the step marketplace drop-down:

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/step-versions.png"
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/step-versions.png"
alt="Different step versions"
caption="Different step versions"
max-width="60%"
%}

You can also use the Codefresh CLI to list all version:

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh get step-types kostis-codefresh/sample --versions
{% endhighlight %}

To delete a specific version, use:

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh delete step-type 'account/plugin:<version>'
{% endhighlight %}

Note that Codefresh step versions function like Docker tags in the sense that they are *mutable*. You can overwrite an existing plugin version with a new plugin manifest by using the `codefresh replace step-type` command.

If users do not define a version once they use the plugin, the latest one (according to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/)) will be used. Alternatively they can specify the exact version they need (even different versions within the same pipeline.)


 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  my_step_1:
    title: Running old custom step 
    type: kostis-codefresh/sample:1.2.1
  my_step_2:
    title: Running new custom step
    type: kostis-codefresh/sample:1.3.5
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

### Example with input parameters

Let's create a very simple step called *node-version*. This step will read the application version from a NodeJS project and expose it as an environment variable. This way we can use the application version later in the pipeline (for example to tag a docker image).

Here is the respective [step yaml](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/node-version-plugin/read-app-version.yml).

  `plugin.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'

  isPublic: true

            repo: 'my-github-user/my-github-repo'
            revision: 'master'
            git: github

            arguments:
              PACKAGE_JSON_FOLDER: './my-github-repo'
          print_app_version:
            title: Printing app version
            image: alpine
            commands:
              - echo $APP_VERSION
  latest: true
  version: 1.0.0
spec:
  arguments: |-
    {
        "definitions": {},
        "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
        "type": "object",
        "additionalProperties": false,
        "patterns": [],
        "required": [
          "PACKAGE_JSON_FOLDER"
        ],        
        "properties": {
            "PACKAGE_JSON_FOLDER": {
                "type": "string",
                "description": "folder where package.json is located"
            }
        }
    }
  steps:
    main:
      name: kostis-codefresh/node-version
      image: node
      commands:
        - cd $WORK_DIR
        - pwd
        - APP_VERSION=$(node -p -e "require('./package.json').version")
        - echo $APP_VERSION
        - export APP_VERSION
        - cf_export APP_VERSION
      environment:
        - 'WORK_DIR=${{PACKAGE_JSON_FOLDER}}'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

If you look at the `spec` section you will see that the plugin expects a single parameter called `PACKAGE_JSON_FOLDER`. This will
be passed by the plugin user to specify the folder that contains the `package.json` file. This way this plugin can be used for multiple applications. For example, the plugin user might check out 3 different Node.js projects and use the plugin to read the versions of all of them.

The plugin implementation is specified in the `steps` sections. We use the standard [Node Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/_/node) to read the version from the `package.json` file. Notice how we convert the plugin argument to an environment variable called `WORK_DIR`

By default all plugins start with the Codefresh volume at `/codefresh/volume` as a working folder. So with the `cd` command we enter the project folder (which we assume was checked out in a previous pipeline step). Once the version is read it is made available to all the other pipeline steps with the [cf_export command]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/#using-cf_export-command).

We now insert our plugin in the marketplace with the following command:

{% highlight bash %}
codefresh create step-type -f read-app-version.yml
{% endhighlight %}

The step is now ready to be used by anybody.

An example user pipeline is shown at [codefresh.yml](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/node-version-plugin/codefresh.yml)

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    repo: 'codefreshdemo/example_nodejs_postgres'
    revision: 'master'
    git: github    
  read_app_version:
    title: Reading app version
    type: kostis-codefresh/node-version
    arguments:
      PACKAGE_JSON_FOLDER: './example_nodejs_postgres'
  print_app_version:
    title: Printing app version
    image: alpine
    commands:
      - echo $APP_VERSION
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This is a very simple pipeline that checks out a NodeJS project and uses our plugin. Notice how we pass as argument the required parameter `example_nodejs_postgres` to tell the plugin where our `package.json` file is located. Once the plugin runs the application version is available as an environment variable that we can use in other steps as `APP_VERSION`.

This is a trivial example, but is still shows how Codefresh pipeline can be declarative while actually doing a lot of imperative actions behind the scenes.

### Example with output parameters

In the previous example our plugin had an output parameter (`APP_VERSION`) that is created by the custom step and given back to the user. Even though creating an output parameter using only `cf_export` will work just fine in the technical level, it is best to formally define output parameters in the step definition.

If you define output parameters in the step definition their names will appear on the marketplace and users will have an easier time understand what your step produces. You will be able to define complete JSON objects in addition to output strings. Formal output parameters are also available under a special notation (`step.outputs`) that we will explain in this example.

We suggest you always formalize your output parameters in your step definition, especially when your step is having a large number of output parameters.

The same [JSON Schema](http://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples.html) is also used for output parameters as with input ones.
Here is a [very simple example](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/output-parameters/output-parameters-sample.yml) that shows the different types of output parameters you can have.

    }    
  steps:
    main:
      name: kostis-codefresh/output-parameters-example
      image: alpine
      commands:
        - cf_export MY_NUMBER=42
        - cf_export MY_CITY='{"city_name":"San Francisco", "country":"usa","population":884363}' 
        - cf_export MY_FAVORITE_FOOD='["pizza", "ramen", "hot dogs"]'

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This plugin exports 3 output parameters

* `MY_NUMBER` - a single number
* `MY_CITY` - an object with fields `city_name`, `country`, `population`
* `MY_FAVORITE_FOOD` - an array.

Output parameters are defined in the `returns` block.
The output parameters of the step are now shown in the marketplace so consumers of this plugin know what to expect when they use it.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/output-parameters-definition.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/output-parameters-definition.png"
alt="Output parameters on marketplace" 
caption="Output parameters on marketplace" 
max-width="40%" 
%}

As can be seen from the `examples` block, when you have formal output parameters you can also access them by mentioning the specific steps in your pipeline that creates it. The following are two equal ways to use an output parameter in your pipeline:

```
{% raw %}
echo $MY_NUMBER
echo ${{steps.dummy_parameters.output.MY_NUMBER}}
{% endraw %}
```

In the case of output parameters that are objects you can also use `jq` to get specific properties like this:

```
{% raw %}
echo ${{steps.dummy_parameters.output.MY_CITY}} | jq '.city_name'
{% endraw %}
```

This will print "San Francisco".


### Example with input/output parameters

Let's take everything we learned from the previous examples and create a custom step that has

1. A custom Docker image
1. Formal input parameters
1. Format output parameters

In this simple example we will create a custom step that reads the Maven coordinates from a `pom.xml` file. Unlike `package.json`, a Maven file has 3 characteristics (group, artifact name and version). First we create a [very simple executable](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/maven-version-plugin/mvncoords.go) that reads a Maven file and gives us these coordinates in JSON format.

{% highlight shell %}
{% raw %}
mvncoords -f pom.xml
{"groupId":"com.example.codefresh","artifactId":"my-java-app","version":"3.0.2"}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Next, we package this executable in a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/maven-version-plugin/Dockerfile).

 `Dockerfile`
{% highlight docker %}
{% raw %}
FROM golang:1.12-alpine AS build_base

WORKDIR /tmp/

COPY . .

# Unit tests
RUN go test -v

# Build the Go app
RUN go build -o ./out/mvncoords .

# Start fresh from a smaller image
FROM alpine:3.9 

COPY --from=build_base /tmp/out/mvncoords /usr/local/bin/mvncoords

CMD ["mvncoords"]
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We now have a custom Docker image that contains our executable. If we want other people to use it, we need to push it to Dockerhub. You can do this manually from your workstation using `docker login` and `docker push` commands, but it is much better to automate this with a Codefresh pipeline.


{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/create-plugin-image.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/create-plugin-image.png"
alt="Building a public Docker image" 
caption="Building a public Docker image" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

This [pipeline](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/maven-version-plugin/codefresh.yml) checks out the Dockerfile plus source code, builds the docker image and then pushes it to Dockerhub (so that the image is public).

Finally we are ready to create our Codefresh plugin. Here is the [specification](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/maven-version-plugin/read-maven-version.yml):

                    "artifactId": {"type": "string"},
                    "version": {"type": "string"}
                }
            }
        }
    }  
  steps:
    main:
      name: kostis-codefresh/mvn-version
      image: kkapelon/maven-version-extract
      commands:
        - cd $WORK_DIR
        - MVN_COORDS=$(mvncoords -json)
        - export MVN_COORDS
        - cf_export MVN_COORDS
      environment:
        - 'WORK_DIR=${{POM_XML_FOLDER}}'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We place this plugin into the marketplace with

```
codefresh create step-type -f read-maven-version.yml
```

If you look at the plugin entry in the marketplace you will see both input (the folder of the pom.xml) and output parameters (mvn coordinates) defined:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/plugin-parameters.png" 
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/plugin-parameters.png"
alt="Input and output parameters" 
caption="Input and output parameters" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

The plugin is now ready to be used in a pipeline:

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/plugin-usage.png"
url="/images/codefresh-yaml/steps/plugin-usage.png"
alt="Plugin usage"
caption="Plugin usage"
max-width="60%"
%}

If you look at the [pipeline definition](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/maven-version-plugin/codefresh-example.yml) you will see how we pass arguments in the plugin and get its output with the `steps.output` syntax.


  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    repo: 'codefresh-contrib/spring-boot-2-sample-app'
    revision: 'master'
    git: github
  read_app_version:
    title: Reading app version
    type: kostis-codefresh/mvn-version
    arguments:
      POM_XML_FOLDER: './spring-boot-2-sample-app'
  print_app_version:
    title: Printing app version
    image: alpine
    commands:
      - echo $MVN_COORDS
      - echo ${{steps.read_app_version.output.MVN_COORDS}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This was a trivial example, but it clearly demonstrates how a custom step communicates with the rest of the pipeline by getting input from the previous steps and preparing output for the steps that follow it.

### Exporting parameters manually inside a plugin

Normally in a pipeline you can either use the [cf_export]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/#using-cf_export-command) command or write directly to the [/codefresh/volume/env_vars_to_export]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/#directly-writing-to-the-file) file.

However inside a plugin you can also use the `/meta/env_vars_to_export` file that has the same semantics, but is used for exporting variables in the same scope as the plugin only.

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
  steps:
    export_my_variable:
       title: "Exporting custom variable"
       image: alpine     
       commands:
         - echo MY_PLUGIN_VAR=SAMPLE_VALUE >> /meta/env_vars_to_export   
    read_my_variable:
       title: "Reading custom variable"
       image: alpine     
       commands:
         - echo $MY_PLUGIN_VAR
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

You can still use `cf_export` command inside the plugin as well (as shown in the previous examples).


### Example with step templating

As an advanced technique, Codefresh allows you to define a custom step using templating instead of fixed YAML. We support templates inside the `spec:` block of a plugin definition by taking advantage of the [Gomplate](https://github.com/hairyhenderson/gomplate) library that offers additional templating functions on top of vanilla [Go templates](https://golang.org/pkg/text/template/).

As a simple example lets say we want to create a single step that checks out any number of git repositories. Of course you could just copy-paste the git clone step multiple times in a single pipeline. To make things easier we will create a single step that takes an array of git repositories and checks them out on its own:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
checkout_many_projects:
  title: Checking out my Git projects
  type: kostis-codefresh/multi-git-clone
  arguments:
    GIT_PROJECTS: 
    - 'codefresh-contrib/ruby-on-rails-sample-app'
    - 'kubernetes/sample-apiserver'
    - 'kostis-codefresh/nestjs-example'
    - 'spring-projects/spring-petclinic'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The GitHub projects are passed as an array, so if we want to check out an additional project, we simply add items to that array.

Here is the [step specification](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/multi-clone/multi-clone-step.yml):

  `plugin.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}

        }
    }

        - echo "Checking out [[ len  .Arguments.GIT_PROJECTS ]] git projects"

      revision: [[$.Arguments.GIT_REVISION]]
      git: [[$.Arguments.GIT_PROVIDER]]
    [[end]]          
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

There are two important points here:

1. Instead of using a `steps:` block, we instead define a block called `stepsTemplate:`. This block name instructs Codefresh that we will use templates
1. Because the Codefresh runtime is already using the double curly braces for variables mentioned as {% raw %}`${{MY_VARIABLE_EXAMPLE}}`{% endraw %}, we instead define templates with the characters {% raw %}`[[]]`{% endraw %}. You can see  the definitions for these characters inside the `delimiters:` block. You are free to use any other replacement characters of your choosing.

In the `stepsTemplate` block we use Golang template keywoards such as `range`, `len` and template variables (such as `git_project`). You can use all the capabilities of Go templates (e.g. `if`, `range`, `with`) as well as the extra methods of [gomplate](https://docs.gomplate.ca/) such as math and net functions.

Creating the [marketplace entry](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/kostis-codefresh%2Fmulti-git-clone) for a step with templates is exactly the same as any other step:

```
codefresh create step-type -f multi-clone-step.yml
```

You can then use the step in [any pipeline](https://github.com/kostis-codefresh/step-examples/blob/master/multi-clone/codefresh.yml) and pass the arguments that will fill the template:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
    checkout_many_projects:
      title: Checking out my Git projects
      type: kostis-codefresh/multi-git-clone
      arguments:
        GIT_REVISION: 'master'
        GIT_PROVIDER: 'github'
        GIT_PROJECTS: 
          - 'codefresh-contrib/ruby-on-rails-sample-app'
          - 'kubernetes/sample-apiserver'
          - 'kostis-codefresh/nestjs-example'
          - 'spring-projects/spring-petclinic'
    print_my_workspace:
      title: Show projects
      image: alpine
      commands:
        - ls -l
        - pwd
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

We have also added two extra parameters, one for the git revision and one for the [git provider]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/git-providers/)  that will be used during checkout.

The end result is that with a single step you can checkout many projects. Checking out an additional project is as simple as adding a new entry in the `GIT_PROJECTS` array.

{% include

alt="Checking out multiple Git repositories in a single step"
caption="Checking out multiple Git repositories in a single step"
max-width="60%"

This was a contrived example to demonstrate how you can use templates in the Codefresh plugin specification. Note that using templates in Codefresh steps is an advanced technique and should be used sparingly.

### Limitations of custom plugins

Custom steps are not compatible with [service containers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/service-containers/). 
More specifically:

 * If you have a [service container in the pipeline-level]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/service-containers/#running-services-for-the-duration-of-the-pipeline), steps inside the custom plugin will not be able to access it
 * If you try to attach a service container to a custom plugin, the plugin will fail when executed
 * If you try to define a custom plugin where a step inside it has a service container attached, the custom plugin will fail when executed
