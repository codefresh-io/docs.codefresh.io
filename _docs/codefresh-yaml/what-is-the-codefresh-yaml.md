Codefresh offers its own built-in format for creating pipelines. The pipeline specification is
based on the YAML syntax allowing you to describe your pipelines in a completely declarative manner.

Using Codefresh yaml is the recommended way to [create pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/pipelines/).

## Simple example for codefresh.yml

Here is a very minimal example:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  build_image:
    type: build
    description: Building the image...
    image-name: myuser/myservice
    tag: develop # {% raw %}${{CF_BRANCH}}{% endraw %}

  perform_tests:
    image: node:5
    working_directory: {% raw %}${{main_clone}}{% endraw %}
    description: Performing unit tests...
    commands:
      - npm install gulp -g 
      - npm install
      - gulp unit_test
{% endhighlight %}

It contains two [steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/), one named *build_image* that creates a docker image, and another one called *perform_tests* that runs unit test with `gulp`.

If you want to know more about how steps work in Codefresh make sure to read [the introduction to Pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/introduction-to-codefresh-pipelines/) first, before moving on.

## Basic skeleton of a codefresh.yml file.

You can customize your build environment (pipeline) by using the Codefresh YAML file, ```codefresh.yml```. Codefresh uses the build specifications in the ```codefresh.yml``` file to execute your build. The ```codefresh.yml``` can be basic, or include intricate build specifications.

A YAML file is comprised of a series of steps that are executed in the order in which they are specified.

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'

steps:
  step-name:
    [step-contents]
  another-step:
    [step-contents]
  the-very-last-step:
    [step-contents]
{% endhighlight %}
 
You must define a step type for each step. Each step uses Docker images and containers as facilitators for execution. For example, the [**Freestyle**]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/) step spins up a container and executes the specified shell commands from the YAML file. 

Each step produces a resource, which you can reference in other steps, and are executed in real-time. For example, a [**Freestyle**]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/) step can reference an image that was produced by a [**Build**]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/build-1/) step. This allows you to chain steps together, and create highly-customized builds.

To build your pipeline using a ```codefresh.yml``` file, in the General Settings section, toggle the ```Use YML build``` option to the **ON** position.

{% include image.html lightbox="true" file="/images/5c37025-Screen_Shot_2017-10-16_at_9.50.48_PM.png" url="/images/5c37025-Screen_Shot_2017-10-16_at_9.50.48_PM.png" alt="pipeline definition options" caption="Switching between the legacy build engine and the YAML build engine" max-width="40%" %}

## Execution flow

By default Codefresh will execute all steps in the yaml file and instantly fail the build, if any step
presents an error. To change this behavior add the `fail_fast:false` property in any step that you wish to be ignored
in case of errors. 

For example, if you have a [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/freestyle/) that runs integration tests, and you don't want the whole pipeline
to fail if any of the tests fail, add the `fail_fast` line to that step:

  
{% highlight yaml %}
perform_tests:
    image: node:9
    description: Running integration tests
    fail_fast: false
    commands:
      - gulp integration_test
{% endhighlight %}

Now the pipeline will continue to run even if the step `perform_tests` fails.

Notice also that by default Codefresh pipelines run in *sequential mode*. All steps will be executed one after
the other and in the same order as included in the `codefresh.yml` file.

If you wish to use parallel steps in your pipelines, see the [parallel steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/advanced-workflows/) page.

## Retrying a step

Sometimes you want to retry a step that has a problem. Network hiccups, transient failures and flaky test environments are common problems that prevent pipelines from working in a predictable manner.

Codefresh allows you to retry any of your steps with the built-in syntax:

  `yaml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
step-name:
    [step-contents]
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 5
      delay: 5
      exponentialFactor: 2
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The `retry:` block has the following parameters:

  * `maxAttempts` defines how many times this step will run again if there are execution errors. Default is 1.
  * `delay` is the number of seconds to wait before each attempt. Default is 5 seconds
  * `exponentialFactor` defines how many times the delay should be multiplied by itself after each attempt. default is 1

All parameters are optional. The exponentialFactor works like this:
* exponentialFactor=1, delay=5 => each time wait 5 seconds before trying again, no matter the number of attempts
* exponentialFactor=2, delay=5 => first retry will have a delay of 25 seconds, third will have 125 and so on


Here is a full example:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    image_name: my-own-app
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 2
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running Unit tests
    image: alpine:3.8
    image: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    commands:
    - ./my_unit_tests.sh
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 3
      delay: 5
  PushingToRegistry:
    type: push
    title: Pushing To Registry
    candidate: ${{MyAppDockerImage}}
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH}}'
    retry:
      maxAttempts: 3
      delay: 3
      exponentialFactor: 2
{% endraw %}      
{% endhighlight %}

Notice that Codefresh also provides the following variables that allow you change your script/applications according to the retry attempts:

* `CF_CURRENT_ATTEMPT` contains the number of current retry attempt
* `CF_MAX_ATTEMPTS` contains all the number of total attempts defined



## Grouping steps with pipeline stages

By default all pipeline steps are shown one after the other.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/yaml/linear-view.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/yaml/linear-view.png"
alt="Default pipeline view" 
caption="Default pipeline view"
max-width="50%"
%}

This view works ok for small pipelines, but for a big number of steps it is better to group them into pipeline *stages* like shown below:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/yaml/example.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/yaml/example.png"
alt="Different pipeline stages" 
caption="Different pipeline stages"
max-width="80%"
%}

The number of stages (i.e columns) and their titles is completely configurable. 
To enable this view you need to make two modifications at the `codefresh.yml` file:

Here is the skeleton:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
 - [stage-name-1]
 - [stage-name-2]

steps:
  step-name:
    [step-contents]
    stage: [name-of-stage]
  another-step:
    [step-contents]
    stage: [name-of-stage]
  the-very-last-step:
    [step-contents]
    stage: [name-of-stage]
{% endhighlight %}

As you can see the modifications needed are:

1. List all the stage names at the root of the pipeline file
1. Use the `stage` property on each step to assign it to a stage.

>This updated pipeline view is only a nice way to visualize the pipeline. It does not affect the order of step execution. Steps will still execute in the same order listed in the `codefresh.yml` file. If you wish to use parallel execution and advanced workflows see the [parallel steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/advanced-workflows/) page.

Here is a more concrete example that you can use as a starting point:

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
 - prepare
 - test
 - build
 - scan
 - integration
 - deploy
steps:
    step1:
        stage: 'prepare'
        image: node
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 1!"'
    step2:
       image: node
       stage: 'prepare'
       commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 2!"'
    step3:
        image: node
        stage: 'test'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 3!"'
    step4:
        image: node
        stage: 'build'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 4!"'
    step5:
        image: node
        stage: 'scan'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 5!"'
    step6:
        image: node
        stage: 'scan'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 6!"'
    step7:
        image: node
        stage: 'integration'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 7!"'        
    step8:
        image: node
        stage: 'deploy'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 8!"'    
    step9:
        image: node
        stage: 'deploy'
        commands:
            - 'echo "Hello Step 9!"'    
{% endhighlight %}

If you run the pipeline you will see this view

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/pipeline/yaml/complex.png" 
url="/images/pipeline/yaml/complex.png"
alt="Complex Pipeline view" 
caption="Complex Pipeline view"
max-width="80%"
%}

Remember that the assignment of a step to a stage is happening only for graphical grouping purposes. It does
not affect the way your steps run. All steps will still run in the same order mentioned in the `codefresh.yml` file.

Also notice if you enable this view a stage called *default* will show all build steps that are not explicitly assigned to a stage.
