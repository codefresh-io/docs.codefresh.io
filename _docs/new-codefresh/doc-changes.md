The doc site includes documentation for both Codefresh pipelines and Codefresh GitOps powered by Argo CD.  
We have merged and moved content to accomodate both modules.  

 
Notes:
* Quick Starts
  We have created different quick starts for Codefresh pipelines and GitOps to get you up and running with both. 

* Pipelines  
    * Pipeline documentation from Configure CD/CD Pipelines and Codefresh YAML have been merged into Piplelines.
    * Documentation for pipeline integrations are  Codefresh pipelines are now in Pipeline integrations.

* Kubernetes and Helm deployments  
  Documentation is now in Deployments > Kubernetes and Deployments > Helm, respectively.

* Changelog and What's New  
    * The Changelog includes changes to Codefresh pipeline documentation.
    * The What's New includes changes to GitOps documentation.
  We plan to merge both into a single What's New article. Stay tuned for the announcement.
