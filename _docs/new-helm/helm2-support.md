At Codefresh, we support both Helm 2 and Helm 3 releases, both in the graphical dashboards and in pipeline steps.

However, the Helm team has discontinued all Helm support since [November 2020](https://helm.sh/blog/helm-v2-deprecation-timeline/). 
Therefore:
* No new Helm 2 releases (not even for security updates)
* “Stable” and “Incubator" repositories will be discontinued
* [https://github.com/helm/charts](https://github.com/helm/charts) is now obsolete

For migrating your Helm 2 charts you can use the [helm-2to3 plugin](https://github.com/helm/helm-2to3)

Codefresh will also discontinue support for Helm 2 on July 16 2021. After this date: 
1. All Codefresh Helm dashboards including the [Helm releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/helm-releases-management/), and [promotions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/helm-environment-promotion/) will only support Helm 3 clusters and namespaces. 
2. The Codefresh Helm [step](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/helm) will only support Helm 3.

Please contact us at support@codefresh.io if you have any questions or concerns.
