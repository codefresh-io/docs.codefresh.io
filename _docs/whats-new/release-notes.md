## April 2023

### Features & Enhancements

#### Pipelines: Annotations for builds
We are happy to introduce two cool features to annotations for pipeline builds! It’s now easier than ever to find the builds you’re looking for, and customize your build views.

First, you can configure an annotation as the build's _display_ annotation, from among the available annotations. Why would you do this? When configured, the annotation is displayed for the build in the Builds page, making it easy to see which builds share common properties like target environments.  

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-builds-list-with-display-annotation.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-builds-list-with-display-annotation.png"
 alt="Builds page with `display` annotations"
 caption="Builds page with `display` annotations"
 max-width="50%"
%}

For details, see [Configure display annotation for builds]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/annotations/#configure-annotation-to-display-for-build).

Second, as an obvious extension, you can filter builds by annotations. Filter builds by any annotation added for the build, whether it’s a display annotation or any other annotation with the Annotation filter in the Builds page.   
For details, see [Applying filters to build views]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#applying-filters-on-the-build-view).

Here's an example of builds filtered by `display` annotations.

#### Pipelines: Project-based ABAC

We are excited to announce project-level Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) in this month's release. ABAC for projects saves a lot of effort without compromising security, as now you can control access to the project entity and to pipeline entities based on project tags.

How can you do this?
First by creating projects and by assigning tags to projects and then creating rules. 

* Project access to teams with project-tags
  Decide which teams have access to which projects, and at which level. By adding tags to projects, you can define rules for different teams who can create, update, delete, and view projects. For example, you may decide that the DevOps team has full access to all projects with all tags, but the Users team has view-only access to projects with `Shared` tag.
  Also, read the next feature description, [Pipelines: Auto-create projects for teams](#pipelines-auto-create-projects-for-teams).

* Pipeline access to teams with project-tags
  Create rules for pipeline entities by project tags instead of pipeline tags. Define access to pipelines on the basis of the projects that house the pipelines. Instead of tagging each pipeline, you add tags to the project, and define rules that determine the teams who can access the pipelines which share the project tags. 

  Builds now honor the permissions of the pipelines. If you don't have access to the pipeline, you will not have access to its builds.
  This also means fewer email notifications, as these are only sent for builds you have access to. 

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-project-tags-devops.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-project-tags-devops.png"
 alt="Example of rules for pipelines with project tags"
 caption="Example of rules for pipelines with project tags "
 max-width="50%"
%}

For details, see [ABAC for entities with tags and rules]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/#abac-for-entities-with-tags-and-rules).

<br>

#### Pipelines: Auto-create projects for teams
Simplify access control and setup with `Auto-create projects for teams`. Enabled by default, this global pipeline setting automatically creates projects whenever you create teams in your account. 

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-auto-create-projects-setting.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-auto-create-projects-setting.png"
 alt="Auto-create projects for teams in Pipeline settings"
 caption="Auto-create projects for teams in Pipeline settings"
 max-width="50%"
%}

In addition to automatically creating a project for the team, it also automatically creates a Project rule, and a Pipeline rule for the same team, with basic permissions.
For details, see [Auto-create projects for teams]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/pipeline-settings/#auto-create-projects-for-teams).

<br>

#### Pipelines: Multi-platform builds in Codefresh
Build and push Docker images, including multi-platform images in Codefresh with BuildX. 

We have extended the capabilities of our `build` step with the new `buildx` field. Leverage Docker’s support for multi-architecture/multi-platform support right here in Codefresh. Build an image once and reuse it on multiple architectures/platforms.
We also support custom `buildx` configurations with QEMU and Builder, giving you all the options you may need.  

For details, see [Build step field descriptions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/#fields). 

<br>

#### Pipelines: (On-premises) Custom root CA for services
On-premises installations can now configure custom Root CA for volumes and containers.  
Reference the K8s secret containing the root CA in `config.yaml`. Define the volume or volumes with the K8s secret objects, and then the volume mounts for the container.  

For details, see [Configure custom Root CA for volumes and containers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/codefresh-on-prem/#configure-custom-root-ca-for-volumes-and-containers).

<br>

#### GitOps: Rollback GitOps applications
We now have the Rollback feature for GitOps applications! With just a click of a button, you can rollback any new or active version of an application directly from the GitOps Apps dashboard in Codefresh. 

Like Argo CD, Codefresh allows you to rollback to any of the ten previous deployment versions. 

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-app-rollback.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-apr23-app-rollback.png"
 alt="Rollback for GitOps applications"
 caption="Rollback for GitOps applications"
 max-width="50%"
%}

For details, see [Rollback GitOps applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/manage-application/#rollback-gitops-applications).

<br>

#### GitOps: Static integration option for Amazon ECR
We extended the integration options for Amazon Elastic Container Registry (ECR) in GitOps to include static integrations with Access keys. 

You can now set up the integration with Amazon ECR using an access key and secret (static integration). Unlike IAM roles, access keys are long-term credentials, without a default expiration date.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-ecr-access-key-int.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-ecr-access-key-int.png"
 alt="Access Key (static) integration for GitOps Amazon ECR"
 caption="Access Key (static) integration for GitOps Amazon ECR"
 max-width="50%"
%}

For details, see [GitOps Amazon ECR integration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/container-registries/amazon-ecr).



### Bug fixes

## March 2023

### Features & Enhancements

#### Pipelines: Selective restart for failed build steps
We added the **Restart from a failed step** as an option to the pipeline's Policy settings, which you can enable/disable per pipeline. 
{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-restart-failed.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-restart-failed.png"
 alt="Restart from failed step option in Pipeline settings"
 caption="Restart from failed step option in Pipeline settings"
 max-width="50%"
%}

Previously, this option was available for all pipelines in the Builds page. Now, you can make it available according to the requirements of the specific pipeline. When disabled in the pipeline's settings, it is also disabled for that pipeline in the Builds page.

Why did we make this selective per pipeline?  
Because restarting from a failed step is not always the answer to the problem, especially as the pipelines restarts with the same state as before. 

If you have a failed Helm promotion step, and you updated the image, you would want the pipeline to use the new image. With the Restart option, the pipeline resumes execution at the same state as at the point of failure, never uses the updated image, and continues to fail.  

For details, see [Policy settings for pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#policies) and [Restarting pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#restarting-the-pipeline).

<br>

#### Pipelines: Datadog integration enhancements
We enhanced our integration with Datadog to report additional information from Codefresh pipelines in Datadog. 
<br> 
The new information should make it even easier to monitor and analyze Codefresh pipelines in Datadog: 

* For manually triggered pipelines, the name of the user who initiated the pipeline.
* The Resumed field, if the pipeline was resumed after manual approval.
* The Parameters field with user-defined variables and Git parameters.
* Error messages for pipelines with errors.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-datadog.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-datadog.png"
 alt="Codefresh pipeline parameters in Datadog"
 caption="Codefresh pipeline parameters in Datadog"
 max-width="50%"
%}

See [Datadog pipeline integration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/datadog/).

<br>



#### Pipelines: Override runtime environment for GitOps pipeline integrations
A GitOps pipeline integration uses the default runtime environment. After creating a GitOps pipeline integration, you can now override its runtime environment.
Codefresh uses the runtime environment for system actions such as Rollback.



{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-classic-gitops-runtime-env.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-classic-gitops-runtime-env.png"
 alt="Selecting runtime environment for GitOps pipeline integration"
 caption="Selecting runtime environment for GitOps pipeline integration"
 max-width="50%"
%}



<br>


#### GitOps: Deep links to applications
Codefresh supports adding Deep Links to third-party applications/platforms. Deep Links is an Argo CD feature that allows you to configure deep links to any third-party application/platform such as Splunk for example, to quickly redirect users to these applications/platforms. 

When configured, the Current State Tree view displays the linked-to applications in the resource's context menu.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-deep-links.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-deep-links.png"
 alt="Deep Links in application resource's context menu"
 caption="Deep Links in application resource's context menu"
 max-width="50%"
%}


For details, see [Configuring Deep Links to applications/resources for Hybrid GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/monitor-manage-runtimes/#hybrid-gitops-configure-deep-links-to-applications--resources).

<br>

#### GitOps: Runtime name and namespace decoupled
We removed the dependency between the runtime name and namespace for Hybrid GitOps runtimes.
From CLI version v0.1.41, and runtime version: v0.1.27, you can have different names for runtimes and namespaces. 

<br>

#### GitOps Apps dashboard usability enhancements

* **New icons for health status**  
  The color-coded borders around application resources that indicated their health status were not the most intuitive and easy to identify.  
  We listened to your feedback, and replaced them with a set of icons affixed to the resource type:<br>
  {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/icons/current-state-healthy.png" display=inline-block"> Healthy, <img src="../../../images/icons/current-state-progressing.png" display=inline-block"> Progressing, <img src="../../../images/icons/current-state-suspended.png" display=inline-block"> Suspended, <img src="../../../images/icons/current-state-missing.png" display=inline-block"> Missing, <img src="../../../images/icons/current-state-degraded.png" display=inline-block/> Degraded, and <img src="../../../images/icons/current-state-unknown.png" display=inline-block/> Unknown.
  {:/}     


* **Filter by K8s labels**  
  Also in the GitOps Apps dashboard, you can filter applications by Kubernetes labels.  

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-label-filters-apps.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-mar23-label-filters-apps.png"
 alt="Filter applications by Kubernetes labels"
 caption="Filter applications by Kubernetes labels"
 max-width="40%"
%}

See [Monitoring GitOps applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/).  

<br>

### Bug fixes

#### Pipelines

## February 2023

### Features & Enhancements

#### Pipelines: Slack integration notification for builds terminated by system
Notifications for failed builds are equally, if not more important, than those for successful builds. Getting notifications for system-terminated builds is crucial, as it indicates that the build was stopped because of pipeline policy and may require immediate attention. You can quickly investigate the issue and take corrective action if necessary.


We added a new option to our Slack integration to notify you whenever builds are terminated by the system. 

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-slack-failed-notification.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-slack-failed-notification.png"
 alt="Slack notification option for system-terminated builds"
 caption="Slack notification option for system-terminated builds"
 max-width="50%"
%}

Here's an example of the notification you would receive in Slack.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-terminate-build-slack-example.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-terminate-build-slack-example.png"
 alt="Example Slack notification for system-terminated builds"
 caption="Slack notification for system-terminated builds"
 max-width="50%"
%}

<br>

#### Pipelines: Multiple Helm contexts for pipelines
With support for multiple Helm registry contexts in the same pipeline, dependencies in any of the imported Helm registry contexts in the Helm chart are automatically authenticated and added.
For the Helm `install` and `push` actions, you can select the primary Helm registry context for the command.
For details, see [Import Helm configurations into your pipeline definition]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/#step-4-optional-import-helm-configurations-into-your-pipeline-definition) and [Action modes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/#helm-step-action-modes).


<br>

#### Pipelines: Multiple cache sources for pipeline builds

Docker has support for specifying external cache sources for builds. We added the `cache-from` argument to our `build` step allowing you to specify additional cache sources and speed up the build process. Multiple cache sources are useful when your primary cache source is unavailable or slow.

Here's an example of `cache-from` with `buildkit`:

{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  BuildMyImage:
    title: Building My Docker image
    type: build
    image_name: my-app-image
    dockerfile: my-custom.Dockerfile
    tag: 1.0.1
    buildkit: true
    build_arguments:
    - BUILDKIT_INLINE_CACHE=1
    cache_from:
    - my-registry/my-app-image:${{CF_BRANCH}}
    - my-registry/my-app-image:master
{% endraw %}         
{% endhighlight %}

For details, see [`cache_from` in `build` step fields]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/#fields).

<br>

#### Pipelines: Control thresholds for memory usage warning banner
Remember the banner that alerted you whenever the memory usage for a pipeline build exceeded 70 or 90%?
You can now decide the usage threshold at which to display the banner. Increasing the threshold helps avoid premature warnings for pipelines that do not consume a lot of memory, while decreasing it for resource-intensive pipelines helps avoid build failures. 

As part of the account-level configuration settings for pipelines (**Toolbar Settings > Pipeline Settings**), you can decide to display the banner when memory usage exceeds 70%, 90% (as before), or the actual limit of 100% (new option). 


{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-build-memory-warning.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-build-memory-warning.png"
 alt="Options for memory usage limit warning banner"
 caption="Options for memory usage limit warning banner"
 max-width="50%"
%}

Users can then override the memory-usage threshold for individual pipelines.
See [Memory usage warning for pipeline builds]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/pipeline-settings/#memory-usage-warning-for-pipeline-builds).


<br>

#### Pipelines: New flow for Cloud Builds for pipelines
Previously, all Codefresh accounts had access to a SaaS runtime environment to run pipelines. However, this is no longer the case. Account administrators can request SaaS runtime environments by clicking **Enable Cloud Builds** in Codefresh. This action triggers an email request to Codefresh, and you should receive a response within 24 hours.


<br>

#### GitOps: Upgrade to Argo CD 2.6
We have upgraded the Argo CD version for our GitOps module to v2.6. 
For details, see [Argo CD Releases](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-cd/releases){:target="\_build"}.


<br>

#### Usability enhancements
Saves time and ease of use in interactions with Codefresh.  

* **Pipelines: Prompt to switch accounts**  
  To avoid confusion, when you are signed into more than one Codefresh account, you are prompted to either switch to the active account or return to the previous one. 

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-switch-accnt-prompt.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-switch-accnt-prompt.png"
 alt="Switch active account prompt"
 caption="Switch active account prompt"
 max-width="50%"
%}

* **Pipelines: Case-insensitive search for Pipelines and Pipeline List view**
  Search is now easier as queries are case-insensitive. 

* **GitOps: Terminate Sync now in application header**
We moved the **Terminate Sync** button from the Sync details drawer to the application header making it easy to terminate problematic sync operations if you need to. 


{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-terminate-sync-app-header.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-feb23-terminate-sync-app-header.png"
 alt="Terminate sync option in Application Header"
 caption="Terminate sync option in Application Header"
 max-width="50%"
%}

See [Application header]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#get-status-from-application-header) in [Monitoring GitOps applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/).
