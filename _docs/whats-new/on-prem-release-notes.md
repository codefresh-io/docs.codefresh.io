#### General: Service Accounts for centralized administration

We're excited to announce the launch of service accounts in Codefresh.

##### Why service accounts?

Service accounts make administration simpler. They provide automated processes, applications, and services with the necessary permissions to interact securely with your infrastructure.

   alt="Create service account" 
   caption="Create service account" 
   max-width="60%" 
   %}

##### Key features of service accounts in Codefresh

* **Toggle status**  
  Easily turn service accounts on or off with a toggle. Deactivate service accounts when not in use or invalidate their API keys without removing the account. Reactivate them when needed.

* **RBAC compliance**  
  Assign service accounts to teams to ensure role-based access control (RBAC) compliance for your pipelines.

* **Multiple API keys for granular access**  
  Manage access effortlessly by allowing each service account to hold multiple API keys, each with specific scopes and purposes.

   caption="Service account list" 
   max-width="80%" 
   %}

For details, see [Managing service accounts]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/service-accounts/)

#### General: Personalized menus

We have introduced a powerful feature that gives admins even more control over the Codefresh platform: customizable menus!  

Take control of your account's menu items and personalize the interface to create a more user-friendly and productive environment.
Simplify navigation by hiding unnecessary menu items and decluttering the sidebar, ensuring that users can quickly the pages they need.  


We've added a new page to Settings entitled **Modules**. Admins can decide exactly which menu items are displayed in the sidebar for all users in the account. 

##### How it works
We have three main modules for the plaform:
* Continuous Delivery (CD) with GitOps 
* Continuous Integration (CI) with Pipelines 
* Continuous Delivery (CD) with Pipelines 

By default, all modules, submodules, and menu items are enabled. 

Using the toggle method, you can easily customize what's visible: switch to ON to display an item and OFF to hide it. 

{% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/administration/sidebar-modules/module-disabled.png" 
   url="/images/administration/sidebar-modules/module-disabled.png" 
   alt="Example of main module toggled OFF" 
   caption="Example of main module toggled OFF" 
   max-width="60%" 
   %}


For even more precise control, you can toggle individual pages on or off.

   {% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/administration/sidebar-modules/customized-menu-list.png" 
   url="/images/administration/sidebar-modules/customized-menu-list.png" 
   alt="Example of customized sidebar with pipeline menu items" 
   caption="Example of customized sidebar with pipeline menu items"
   max-width="80%" 
   %}

Admins can always view all hidden items in the sidebar by toggling the **Show in sidebar option...** to ON.

Start streamlining your team's experience today!



#### General: Brand-new search mechanism and experience 
We’re excited to introduce the revamped search mechanism for our doc site!

**Context-aware**  
Wherever you are in Codefresh and open search from the toolbar, either from Global Search & Navigation by typing `help` or by clicking the Help icon, 
you’ll get a curated list of articles that are context-sensitive to your location in the UI to kick-start your search.

Additionally, for an enriched information experience, check out our collection of blog posts from our experts. 

Here are **more reasons** to try the new search:
* **Preview**  
  Check out search results and preview articles before diving in. Just click an article in the list to display it in the Preview panel.
* **View Article**    
  Click View Article on the toolbar of the Preview panel to go straight to the article on the doc site.
* **Share Links**  
  Share useful articles easily with the deep link option, also on the Preview toolbar.
* **Additional Resources**  
  Access handy pages, including our collection of blogs, quickly with permalinks at the bottom of the search results.

{% include

#### Pipelines: RBAC for Pipeline Runtimes
We have further strengthened security for pipelines with RBAC permissions for Pipeline Runtimes.  
RBAC for Pipeline Runtimes enhances the permissions system with granular access control not just for Pipeline Runtimes, but also for runtime environments and resources within pipelines.  


##### Key benefits
* Granular control over runtimes  
  Precisely manage access to runtime environments. For example, restrict access to production environments to safeguard production resources, or grant exclusive access to high-performance runtime environments for high-priority projects, ensuring they have the necessary resources.
* Optimized resource management for runtimes  
  Optimize performance without admin intervention by allowing teams to adjust CPU and memory settings for pipeline builds.


##### How does it work?
Similar to other entities, you implement RBAC for Pipeline Runtimes, runtime builds, and resources, through tags and rules. After adding tags to Pipeline Runtimes, you can define rules for the Pipeline Runtimes, and for runtime environments and resources within pipelines. 

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-pipeline-runtimes-add-tags.png"
url="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-pipeline-runtimes-add-tags.png"
alt="Tags for Pipeline Runtimes"

max-width="60%"
%}


{% include

alt="Rules for runtime environments and resources in pipelines"
caption="Rules for runtime environments and resources in pipelines"
max-width="60%"
%}

For details, see [Assign tags to Pipeline Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/#assign-tags-to-pipeline-runtimes) and [Creating rules for Pipeline Runtimes and runtime environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/#creating-rules-for-pipeline-runtimes-and-runtime-environments).


#### Pipelines: Dedicated environment variables for pull request titles

We’ve made a change to how pull request titles are handled by environment variables in pipelines.

The environment variables {% raw %}`${{CF_COMMIT_MESSAGE}}`{% endraw %} and {% raw %}`${{CF_COMMIT_MESSAGE_ESCAPED}}`{% endraw %} now return the commit message instead of the pull request title.

To get the pull request title, use the new environment variables:
* {% raw %}`${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TITLE}}`{% endraw %}
* {% raw %}`${{CF_PULL_REQUEST_TITLE_ESCAPED}}`{% endraw %}

To use the new variables for pull request titles, update your pipelines accordingly.  As they are already supported by the system, you can begin using them immediately.

For details, see [System variables]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#system-variables).





#### GitOps: Runtime upgrade

The Open Source ArgoCD project published a high-severity security vulnerability. We recommend upgrading your GitOps Runtime to version 0.9.0, which includes a fix for this issue, along with other fixes and features.

This CVE affects webhook processing and is relevant only to customers who have configured webhooks.

To upgrade to the latest release, follow the on-screen instructions to run `helm upgrade`.




#### GitOps: External links for Kubernetes app & ingress resources 
The Current State tab in our GitOps Apps dashboard is the central location to view and manage all the resources in your applications. We are always looking to enhance productivity, and here are the newest features we support: external Links for application and ingress resources! 

##### External links to app resources
External links are user-defined URLs for Kubernetes resources in Argo CD that can point to any external resource such as monitoring pages or documentation. These links, added through annotations in resources, are also rendered in Codefresh, for smooth and easy navigation.    

A Kubernetes resource with external links shows a clickable link icon below the resource's context menu, from which you can navigate to the   next to the resource in the Tree view for easy and smooth navigation. 

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-resource-ext-link.png"
url="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-resource-ext-link.png"
alt="External link for resource in Current State Tree view"
caption="External link for resource in Current State Tree view"
max-width="50%"
%}

##### External links for ingress resources
We also support automatic links for ingress resources! Access links to ingress resources are also automatically generated and rendered in the Current State's Tree view for visibility and easier management.

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-resource-ext-link.png"
url="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-resource-ext-link.png"
alt="Ingress resource links in Current State Tree view"
caption="Ingress resource links in Current State Tree view"
max-width="50%"
%}

For details, see [Access external links]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#access-external-links).

#### GitOps: Application menu enhancements in Environment & Product dashboards

We’ve restructured and redesigned the context menu for applications in the Environments and Products dashboards for easier navigation and quicker access to the information you need!

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-app-menu.png"
url="/images/whats-new/july24/rel-notes-july-24-app-menu.png"
alt="Context menu for applications in Environments and Products"
caption="Context menu for applications in Environments and Products"
max-width="60%"
%}

Here’s a round-up of the changes:  
* **Application Info**  
  A new menu groups handy links for direct access to useful application info.
* **Quick View**  
  Now conveniently available in the Application Info menu.
* **Go to application**
  This new option takes you straight to the Current State tab in the GitOps Apps dashboard for the application.
* **Timeline**  
  Directly opens the deployment history for the application for easy access. No need to click the application name.
* **Diff View**  
  Enabled when an app is out-of-sync, providing direct access to our visual Diff View editor to identify discrepancies between desired and live states.

Other actions remain unchanged. 

For details, see [Working with applications in Environments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/gitops-environments/#working-with-applications-in-environments) and [Working with applications in Products]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/gitops-products/#working-with-applications-in-products).


#### Usability enhancements

##### General: Seamless redirection for shared links 
We implemented a small but significant improvement to your Codefresh experience. 

Now, when you try to access a shared link while not logged into the platform, you will be automatically redirected to the URL you entered after logging in, instead of being taken to the default Home dashboard view.


##### Pipelines: Project name in breadcrumbs in Builds page
In the Builds page, on selecting a build, the breadcrumbs path displays also the project name.

{% include
  image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/whats-new/june24/rel-notes-jun24-project-name-in-builds.png"

If you need a refresher on the new navigation, see our [documentation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-codefresh/menu-navigation/).

#### General: More power to Global Search & Navigation

We're excited to announce major enhancements powering our Global Search & Navigation: 

* **Actions through Search**  
  Execute actions using search or keyboard shortcuts:
  * Run a pipeline: Search to navigate to a specific pipeline, and then use the `R` and `N` shortcut keys to trigger that pipeline.
  * Refresh an application: Search for the application you need, and then use the `R` and `F` shortcut keys to instantly refresh the application.
  * Sync an application: Within an application, use the `S` and `Y` shortcut keys to open the sync dialog.

* **Quick navigation**  
  * **Integrated link to `app-proxy` logs**  
    We've introduced App-proxy logs as a new navigation item. You can now type `App-proxy logs` to access a list of GitOps Runtimes. From there, simply select a Runtime to view its app-proxy logs in the online terminal. 
  * **GitOps Runtimes for admins**  
    Type `GitOps Runtimes` and click to go directly to the GitOps Runtimes page. 
  * **GitOps Permissions for admins**  
    Type `GitOps Permissions` and click to go directly to the Permissions page.

caption="Global Search & Navigation: app-proxy logs" 
max-width="60%" 
%}

#### General: Custom auto-sync intervals for SSO

Previously, integration with different SSO providers allowed automatic user and team synchronization with Codefresh at fixed hourly intervals.

With our latest update, you can now customize the auto-sync intervals to better suit your organization’s needs.  
The new options allow you to set the sync frequency in minutes or hours. Alternatively, you can enable auto-sync without defining a specific interval, and Codefresh will automatically perform the sync every 12 hours. 

This flexibility ensures more timely updates and improved efficiency in user and team management.

For details, see [Syncing teams in IdPs with Codefresh]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/team-sync/#syncing-teams-in-idps-with-codefresh).



#### Pipelines: Explore build relationships with Build Tree
Introducing Build Tree for easy rendering of relationships between pipeline builds!
Seamlessly visualize complex parent-child-sibling relationships within the context of your selected build, simplifying pipeline monitoring and management.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/whats-new/apr24/rel-notes-apr24-build-tree-view.png" 
url="/images/whats-new/apr24/rel-notes-apr24-build-tree-view.png" 
alt="Pipeline builds: Build Tree view" 
caption="Pipeline builds: Build Tree view" 
max-width="60%" 
%}


In addition to the effortless visualization, other key benefits include:
* The selected build as an anchor reference point to linked builds, indicated by the **Current** tag assigned to it.
* Updated status for every build, with failed steps listed for quick alerting.
* Quick access to essential actions without navigating away from the Build Tree, through the build’s context menu.
* Single-click access to the individual build view for detailed insights.

For details, see [Visualize build relationships for pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#visualize-build-relationships-for-pipeline).


#### Pipelines: More Pull Request events support for GitHub
Our integration with GitHub events is now even stronger with the addition of more types of pull request (PR) event triggers.

You can now trigger builds for the following PR events:
* Pull request review approved
* Pull request review changes requested
* Pull request review commented

{% include
  image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/whats-new/apr24/rel-notes-apr24-github-pr-events.png"
  url="/images/whats-new/apr24/rel-notes-apr24-github-pr-events.png"
  alt="New pull request events for GitHub in Codefresh"
  caption="New pull request events for GitHub in Codefresh"
  max-width="60%"
%}

For details, see [Git triggers for pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/triggers/git-triggers/).

#### Pipelines: Gerrit topic variable mapping  

We have introduced a new system variable: `CF_GERRIT_CHANGE_TOPIC`. This variable maps directly to Gerrit’s `topic` variable, which groups related changes together in Gerrit, for better organization and management.

With `CF_GERRIT_CHANGE_TOPIC` in Codefresh pipelines, based on the topic’s context, you can:
* Dynamically manage and execute steps .
* Conditionally trigger specific actions or entire pipelines.

For details, see [System variables in pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#system-variables).

#### Pipelines: Automatic account switching for pipeline builds

Another usability enhancement for a seamless experience when navigating between accounts.  

When accessing pipeline builds from an account different to the one you're logged into, Codefresh automatically switches you to the correct account. This means no more prompts and having to manually select the account.

To support this enhancement, you need to enable the `autoBuildSwitchAccount` Feature Flag.



#### GitOps: GitOps Runtimes as Configuration Runtimes
We added new functionality for GitOps Runtimes. Starting with Runtime v0.1.49, you can now designate a Hosted or any Hybrid GitOps Runtime as a Configuration Runtime.
Configuration Runtimes handle platform-level resources that are runtime-agnostic, such as those for GitOps Products.

{% include
  image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/whats-new/june24/rel-notes-june-24-set-as-config-runtime.png"
  url="/images/whats-new/june24/rel-notes-june-24-set-as-config-runtime.png"
  alt="Set GitOps Runtime as Configuration Runtime"
  caption="Set GitOps Runtime as Configuration Runtime"
  max-width="60%"
%}


Key features to note:
* Redundancy  
  Designate single or multiple GitOps Runtimes as Configuration Runtimes. Codefresh ensures that resources are not duplicated even when there are multiple Configuration Runtimes.
* Ease of use  
  Set and unset a Configuration Runtime with just a click in the UI or a quick edit in your `values.yaml` file.

For details, see [Designating Configuration Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/monitor-manage-runtimes/#designating-configuration-runtimes).

#### GitOps: Rollout enhancements 

* **Templated arguments in AnalysisTemplates**  
Codefresh now supports templated arguments declared in AnalysisTemplates for metric configurations in AnalysisRuns. 

* **Rollout Player**  
To make Rollouts easier to manage, we added the Abort and Retry buttons to the Rollout Player. These options were previously available for the Rollout resource only in the Current State tab.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

max-width="50%" 
%}

For details, see [Manage rollouts for Argo CD application deployments]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/manage-application/#manage-rollouts-for-argo-cd-application-deployments).




#### Usability enhancements



##### Pipelines: Project name in breadcrumbs in Builds page
In the Builds page, on selecting a build, the breadcrumbs path displays also the project name.

{% include
  image.html
  lightbox="true"
  file="/images/whats-new/june24/rel-notes-jun24-project-name-in-builds.png"
  url="/images/whats-new/june24/rel-notes-jun24-project-name-in-builds.png"
  alt="Builds page: Project name in breadcrumbs"
  caption="Builds page: Project name in breadcrumbs"
  max-width="60%"
%}


##### GitOps: Breadcrumbs
We have improved the implementation of breadcrumbs for a smoother navigation experience.

**Entity names in lowercase**  
Within the breadcrumbs path, entity names are now consistently displayed in lowercase.

**Sibling display and navigation**    
The end of the path now shows all sibling items if available.  
Clicking the dropdown displays all siblings, and clicking an item navigates directly to it.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/whats-new/may24/rel-notes-may24-breadcrumbs-siblings.png" 
url="/images/whats-new/may24/rel-notes-may24-breadcrumbs-siblings.png" 
alt="Viewing and navigating to siblings in breadcrumbs" 
caption="Viewing and navigating to siblings in breadcrumbs" 
max-width="40%" 
%}

**Clean selection for copy**  
Clicking any item in the breadcrumb path now selects only that specific item, not the entire path, and also copies that item.  



##### GitOps: Shared Configuration Repo in Organization Information
As a usability enhancement, we have made it easier to locate the Shared Configuration Repository used by GitOps Runtimes. 

You can now find the link to your Shared Configuration Repository directly in the Organization Information page.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/whats-new/may24/rel-notes-may24-shared-config-repo-org-page.png"

## On-premises version 2.3

### Features & enhancements
Here are the features and enhancements included in Codefresh On-Premises v2.3.

#### Install/upgrade to v2.3
Welcome to our newest on-premises release!

**Installing v2.3**
For detailed instructions on installing v2.3, visit [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh){:target="\_blank"}.

**Upgrading to v2.3**
In this release, we changed the default registry for Codefresh _private_ images from Google Container Registry (GCR) `gcr.io` to Google Artifact Registry (GAR) `us-docker.pkg.dev`.  
If you are upgrading to v2.3, you will need to update `.Values.imageCredentials.registry` to `us-docker.pkg.dev`. 

For details, see [Upgrade to 2.3.0 in ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#to-2-3-0){:target="\_blank"}.


#### Pipelines: New `strict_fail_fast` to control pipelines
You’re probably familiar with the `fail_fast` flag available for steps in Codefresh pipelines. The flag determines the pipeline’s behavior when there is a step failure. Accordingly, when set to `false`, the pipeline continues execution and returns a Build status of `Build completed successfully`.  

But what if you want to indicate that a step failed in the Build status even when the pipeline completes execution? Enter our new `strict_fail_fast` flag!  
Now, you can indicate that the step failed execution by simply adding `strict_fail_fast` to the step and setting it to `true`. After the pipeline completes execution, the Build status is designated as Failed.

```yaml
step_name:
  type: git-clone
  title: Step Title
  description: Step description
  ...
  credentials:
    ...
  fail_fast: false
  strict_fail_fast: true
  when:
    branch:
      ignore: [ develop ]
  on_success:
    ...
  on_fail:
    ...
  on_finish:
    ...
  retry:
    ...  
  ...
```
For details, check out the **Fields** table in the documentation for the different step types, as in the [`git-clone` step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/) for example. 

#### Pipelines: Empty variables 
We are happy to announce a highly-requested feature: the ability to use _empty variables_ in Codefresh pipelines.  
Now, you can add variables without any values to entities in Codefresh, whether it's a project, pipeline, or trigger. The enhancement unlocks a myriad of possibilities that were previously unavailable. 

{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-empty-variables.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-empty-variables.png" 
	alt="Empty variables in a Codefresh project" 
	caption="Empty variables in a Codefresh project"
  max-width="40%" 
%}


Remember that encryption is not supported for empty variables. The priority for variable overrides remains unchanged. 

For details, see [User-defined variables in pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#user-defined-variables).

#### Pipelines: Share build run settings
Our newest enhancement to pipeline builds is designed to increase collaboration and productivity! How? Instead of redefining build settings manually, you can effortlessly share pipeline build settings with colleagues who have access to the same account.

**How does it work?**  
By sharing build settings, you enable colleagues to pre-populate build configurations without the need for redundant manual input. This feature is useful for various scenarios, whether it's for testing automation integration with third-party tools or triggering pipelines in specific situations.

**Customizing build settings**  
You can override any existing setting - simulate a different trigger, select a different branch, modify existing or add new build variables, and even modify the build behavior.

With a click of the **Share build settings** button, Codefresh generates a unique URL. The URL includes modified and new settings as query parameters. Encrypted variables are excluded to ensure data protection. 

   {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-share-run-configuration.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-share-run-configuration.png" 
	alt="Share build settings" 
	caption="Share build settings"
  max-width="40%" 
%}

For details, see [Share build run settings]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/run-pipeline/#share-build-run-settings).

#### Pipelines: Restart from failed step 
At Codefresh, we highly value your feedback and are committed to continually enhancing your experience. In response to your feedback, we introduced the ability to configure the default restart behavior for failed steps in a pipeline at the account level. 

   {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-restart-failed-step.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-restart-failed-step.png" 
	alt="Restart from failed step in Pipeline Settings" 
	caption="Restart from failed step in Pipeline Settings"
  max-width="50%" 
%}

When enabled (the default), the user can restart the pipeline directly from the failed step. Otherwise, users can only restart the pipeline from the beginning.  
By default, individual pipelines are configured to inherit the account setting.  
Note that this does not impact existing pipelines.

Being able to configure the restart behavior for failed steps centrally simplifies management and ensures consistency across pipelines, without the need for individual adjustments.   
Imagine a scenario where you’re onboarding a large team of developers. You can disable failed-step restart for the account, and have the pipelines use the account-level setting, saving valuable time and promoting a consistent experience.  

You can always change the behavior at any time based on evolving requirements. And users have the flexibility to override the account-level behavior for individual pipelines based on specific needs.

For details, see [Restarting from failed steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/pipeline-settings/#restarting-from-failed-steps).



#### Pipelines: Explicit versions for typed steps
As you're aware, Codefresh is continually enhancing our typed step library in the Marketplace.

When typed steps in pipelines lack a specified version, Codefresh automatically associates them with the latest version of the step. To avoid potential issues with breaking changes in typed steps, we now provide a warning if there are steps in your pipelines without an explicit version number.

{% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-typed-step-warning.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-typed-step-warning.png" 
	alt="Warning for typed steps without version numbers" 
	caption="Warning for typed steps without version numbers"
  max-width="60%" 
%}

For details, see [Versioning for typed steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/#versioning-for-typed-steps).

#### Pipelines: Blobless Git clone

Here's an enhancement which contributes to workflow optimization -  a new field in our `git_clone` step: the `exclude_blob` field.
Filter out blob files from the Git repository and further streamline your development process. Fewer unnecessary files to clone and faster cloning times!  

For blobless cloning, simply set `exclude_blob` to `true`. To always include blob files, you can retain the default value of `false`.

For details, see [Fields in git-clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/#fields).

#### Pipelines: Add tags during pipeline creation
With this update, you can effortlessly add tags when you create a pipeline, further streamlining the pipeline creation process. Add tags as you usually do, and they are instantly available in both the General Settings and the Permissions panel.

   {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-tags-in-create-pipeline.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-tags-in-create-pipeline.png" 
	alt="Add tags when creating pipeline" 
	caption="Add tags when creating pipeline"
  max-width="40%" 
%}


#### GitOps: Diff View for out-of-sync applications
We’re thrilled to introduce a significant enhancement simplifying troubleshooting Argo CD applications within Codefresh.
With our new Diff View feature, you can instantly view the differences between the current and the desired states of out-of-sync applications.
The Diff View option displays all the updated resources within the application, allowing you to easily pinpoint changes and swiftly identify the root cause of the sync failure.

If you have selected an application, the Diff View option is available in the context menu at the top right of the page. The option is enabled whenever the application is out-of-sync. 

>**NOTE**  
Diff View for application resources is supported from Runtime v1.0.38 and higher. <!--- To enable this feature, you need to turn on the `appDiffView` feature flag.  -->

For details, see [Analyze out-of-sync applications with Diff View]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#analyze-out-of-sync-applications-with-diff-view).



#### GitOps: Tailored sync timeouts for Argo CD applications

Tailor the timeout thresholds for sync operations for different applications, and receive instant alerts when the sync duration exceeds the threshold defined.  
Instead of waiting indefinitely for syncs to complete and then navigating through the GitOps Apps dashboard, Codefresh provides you with timely warnings to proactively investigate and resolve sync issues.

Just include an annotation in the application's YAML, and either retain the default timeout of 30 minutes (also Argo CD's default for sync operations), or change it as needed.  
Codefresh will display a warning in the **Warnings/Errors** panel for the app when the sync operation exceeds the timeout.

   {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-sync-timeout.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-sync-timeout.png" 
	alt="Sync timeout warning for Argo CD applications" 
	caption="Sync timeout warning for Argo CD applications"
  max-width="60%" 
%}

For details, see [Configure sync-timeout for Argo CD applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/manage-application/#configure-sync-timeout-for-argo-cd-applications).

#### GitOps: Argo CD application enhancements

We introduced a couple of usability enhancements for Argo CD applications in Codefresh.  

##### Deployment record for Current Release
To more accurately represent the live deployment status of the selected application in the Timeline tab, we now clearly differentiate between current and historical deployments.

The Current Release is prominently displayed as a dedicated deployment record at the top of the Timelines tab, tagged as the Current Version. It is followed by the list of Previous Releases. 

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/feb24/rel-notes-feb24-current-release-record.png"
url="/images/whats-new/feb24/rel-notes-feb24-current-release-record.png"
alt="Current Release deployment record in Timeline tab"
caption="Current Release deployment record in Timeline tab"
max-width="70%"
%}

* To prevent confusion with duplicate statuses, the application's health and sync statuses are now exclusively displayed and tracked within the Application Header. 

* To validate that the current release as the live state, the release revision in the deployment record mirrors the sync revision displayed in Last Sync Result. 

For details, see [Monitoring deployments for selected Argo CD application]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#monitoring-deployments-for-selected-argo-cd-application).

##### Quick links
The Configuration tab displays handy links to the application's GitOps Runtime, Git Source, and YAML manifest in the Git repo.

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/feb24/rel-notes-feb24-apps-quick-links.png"

alt="Quick links for application in Configuration tab"
caption="Quick links for application in Configuration tab"
max-width="70%"
%}


#### GitOps: View/download logs for GitOps Runtime components
We are glad to announce that you can now view and download logs for individual GitOps Runtime components!
Previously available for legacy CLI Runtimes, this functionality is now back for Helm GitOps Runtimes, with online viewing in our smart terminal and offline downloads as you need.

As a reminder, here's where you can find the **View logs** option:

   {% include 
	image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-runtime-component-log.png" 
	url="/images/whats-new/jan24/rel-notes-jan-24-runtime-component-log.png" 
	alt="View logs for GitOps Runtime components" 
	caption="View logs for GitOps Runtime components"
  max-width="70%" 
%}

For details, see [View/download logs for GitOps Runtime components]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/monitor-manage-runtimes/#viewdownload-logs-for-runtime-components).


#### GitOps: Argo Events upgrade
We've recently upgraded Argo Events to its latest version, v1.9.0, ensuring you can leverage all enhancements. For detailed information about the changes in this version, please refer to the [Argo documentation](https://github.com/argoproj/argo-events/releases){:target="\_blank"}.

Please be aware that this upgrade may introduce a potential breaking change for existing event sources that have defined `githubBaseUrl` without defining `githubUploadURL` which is required. In such cases, event sources will fail to sync, and the Git Source application will return a `..githubUploadURL is required when githubBaseURL is set` error.

To address this, you'll need to edit the event source YAMLs and add `githubUploadURL` where required.

#### GitOps: Deprecation of GitOps CLI for Runtime installation

As we have transitioned to Helm-based Runtimes for GitOps, we have permanently deprecated the CLI-based installation for GitOps Runtimes.

### Feature Flags
Feature Flags are divided into new Feature Flags released in the current version, and changes to existing Feature Flags which are now enabled by default.

## On-premises version 2.2


### Features & enhancements
Features and enhancements are divided into those in general availability and those currently in Beta.
<br>

#### Install/upgrade to v2.2
Welcome to our newest on-premises release!

**Installing v2.2**
For detailed instructions on installing v2.2, visit [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh){:target="\_blank"}.

**Upgrading to v2.2**
Before initiating the upgrade process, review the instructions [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#to-2-2-0){:target="\_blank"}.

<br>

#### Pipelines: Enhanced RBAC with AND logic for tags

We are excited to introduce a powerful enhancement to Codefresh pipelines: AND logic for rules in RBAC permissions. Now, you have even more control and precision when it comes to managing permissions for entities.

Up until this point, we've been all about OR logic, allowing you to define rules with a choice of **Any of these** tags. But we recognize that you need to be more specific in certain scenarios, and that's where AND logic comes into play.
With AND logic, you can require **All of these** tags to be present, providing a level of granularity to tighten security and ensure that only the right teams have access to entities.

{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/sep23/rel-notes-sep23-classic-and-policies.png"
url="/images/whats-new/sep23/rel-notes-sep23-classic-and-policies.png"
alt="Rules with OR/AND logic for tags"
caption="Rules with OR/AND logic for tags"
max-width="40%"
%}

For details, see [ABAC for entities with tags and rules]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/#abac-for-entities-with-tags-and-rules).

<br>

#### Pipelines: New `timeout` functionality for pipeline steps
We are happy to announce a new field for pipeline steps, the `timeout` flag to further enhance control over your pipelines!
The `timeout` flag, when assigned to a step, prevents that step from running beyond a specific duration if so required.

Add the `timeout` flag with the `<duration>` and `<units>` to any of these step types: `git-clone`, `freestyle`, `build`, `push`, `composition`, `pending-approval`.

**How it works**
* Steps that exceed the timeout limit are automatically terminated. If the steps are completed before the timeout limits are exceeded, the timeout values are ignored.
* Steps terminated through timeouts have the same behavior as failed steps. If you notice any inconsistencies, please report them as bugs.
* In parallel steps, by default, the timeout defined for the parent is inherited by child steps.

**Example**

```yaml
version: '1.0'
steps:
  parallel:
    type: parallel
    timeout: 1m
    steps:
      first:
        image: alpine
      second:
        image: alpine
        timeout: 2m
      third:
        image: alpine
        timeout: null
```
For details, see [Git-clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/) and [Add timeouts for parallel steps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/advanced-workflows/#add-timeouts-for-parallel-steps).

<br>

#### Pipelines: Share log URLs for pipeline builds with timestamps
Our latest enhancement simplifies troubleshooting and resolution process for issues in pipeline builds! How? By introducing the ability to share the URL of the build log with your team!

By selecting the part of the build log you want your team to look at for a specific step or for the entire build: a single row, a specific segment, or whatever you need, and clicking **Share**, you get a unique URL.
When colleagues, logged in to the same account, access the shared URL link, the build log opens directly to the highlighted section for easy identification.

{% include

url="/images/whats-new/nov23/rel-notes-nov-23-share-logs-select-lines.png"
alt="Sharing URL for build logs"
caption="Sharing URL for build logs"
max-width="50%"
%}

<!-- **Please note**
Sharing build log URLs requires timestamps in the logs. Codefresh will enable timestamps for all accounts, which can affect automation you may have created based on log output formats without timestamps. To opt out, please contact Codefresh Support.
This functionality will be available for all customers starting December 14.  -->

For details, see [Sharing log URLs for pipeline builds]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#sharing-log-urls-for-pipeline-builds).

<br>

#### Pipelines: Custom audiences for OIDC
You’ll be happy with our latest enhancement for OIDC in Codefresh pipelines. Now, our OIDC integration supports multiple audiences. This flexibility is crucial for working with audiences that require distinct names instead of defaulting to the platform’s hostname, such as the Codefresh platform URL.

**Customize your audience**
In the `obtain-oidc-id-token` step, tailor your audience by defining custom values — either a single value or multiple values separated by commas.

Here’s an example of a single custom audience:

```yaml
obtain_id_token:
  title: Obtain ID Token
  type: obtain-oidc-id-token:1.2.1
  arguments:
    AUDIENCE: "cosign"
```

For details, see [Standard OIDC claims]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/oidc-pipelines/#standard-oidc-claims).

## On-premises version 2.1

### Features & enhancements
<br>

#### Install/upgrade to v2.1
Welcome to our new major on-premises release!

**Installing v2.1**
For detailed instructions on installing v2.1, visit [ArtifactHub](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh){:target="\_blank"}.

**Upgrading to v2.1**
This major release includes new services and updates to existing services.
Before initiating the upgrade process, review the instructions [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#to-2-1-0){:target="\_blank"}.

<br><br>

#### New Helm installation for Codefresh Runner
In this major version, we have completely overhauled the installation process for the Codefresh Runner.
Now, Runner installation is completely Helm-based, making it streamlined and easier to manage.

Starting with this version, Helm becomes the default installation method for the Codefresh Runner. This change has implications for the installation options from previous versions.
* CLI installation is considered legacy, and will not be actively maintained going forward
* For existing Helm installations with chart version 3.x or higher, we recommend migrating to the new chart version for the Runner

The new Helm installation for the Runner is described in [Chart Configuration](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-runner/cf-runtime#chart-configuration){:target="\_blank"} on ArtifactHub.

Refer also to [Codefresh Runner installation]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/runner/install-codefresh-runner/) in the documentation.

<br><br>

#### Gerrit as Git provider for Pipelines and GitOps
We are excited to announce the integration of Gerrit, the open-source web-based code review tool for Git repositories, with Codefresh.

**Gerrit and Codefresh Pipelines**
By integrating Gerrit as a Git provider for Codefresh Pipelines, you can leverage its capabilities to trigger builds and tests automatically whenever a new change is pushed to Git repositories hosted in Gerrit. The integration allows you to closely monitor the status of builds and tests within the Gerrit environment itself, providing you with a comprehensive view of your development process.
With Codefresh’s `CF_PULL_REQUEST` group of environment variables, you can achieve similar functionality to Gerrit’s `Changes` directly within Codefresh.

For details, see [Pipeline integrations - Git providers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/git-providers/#gerrit).

**Gerrit and Codefresh GitOps**
By configuring Gerrit as the primary Git provider for your Hosted GitOps Runtime, you can integrate Gerrit information into your third-party CI tools or platforms for image enrichment and reporting in Codefresh.
If you are interested in using Gerrit for Hybrid GitOps Runtimes, please contact us.

For details, see [GitOps Gerrit Git provider integration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-integrations/gerrit-integration/).

<br><br>

#### Multi-account sync for Okta with OIDC

Check out the latest enhancements to the integration settings for Okta with OIDC: Multi-account sync and automatic deletion of users removed during sync from Codefresh.

**Multi-account sync**
Following the successful implementation of just-in-time provisioning support for Okta, we are taking it a step further by introducing multi-account sync for OIDC-Okta. This feature enables you to synchronize multiple Codefresh accounts in Okta simultaneously in Codefresh, ensuring a seamless SSO setup for enterprise customers.

With multi-account sync, you can easily select additional Codefresh accounts to sync with your Okta OIDC account in Codefresh. Codefresh validates admin privileges and access for each of the selected accounts, guaranteeing secure and reliable authentication.

You have the flexibility to sync users in multiple ways: through the UI's `Auto-group sync`, performing on-demand synchronization through the CLI, or integrating sync into a Codefresh pipeline using the CLI synchronize command.

**Delete users removed during sync**
We added an option to further streamline Okta SSO account and user management in Codefresh. You can now easily remove individual users who are deactivated in Okta from both the current account in Codefresh and any additional accounts defined in your current account.
The Users list is updated accordingly, ensuring that both the Teams and Users lists are always organized.

For details, see [Configure OIDC SSO settings for Okta in Codefresh]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/single-sign-on/oidc/oidc-okta/#how-to).

<br><br>

#### Codefresh & OpenShift
We are excited to announce that Codefresh now supports OpenShift! Seamlessly integrate with OpenShift for enhanced container orchestration capabilities, and discover new possibilities in your deployment workflows with Codefresh and OpenShift integration.

For details, see [Deploying Codefresh with OpenShift](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#installing-on-openshift){:target="\_blank"}.

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: OpenID Connect (OIDC) integration
Introducing OIDC (OpenID Connect) for Codefresh pipelines! Boost pipeline security and streamline access control with OIDC. Instead of referencing static credentials stored in Codefresh for the cloud provider, allow pipelines to authenticate and authorize actions through short-lived ID tokens.

Configure Codefresh as an OIDC provider with your preferred cloud provider, and let Codefresh handle ID token acquisition, and then add the actions to perform on the cloud provider in the pipeline.

Key benefits:
* Enhanced security
  You no longer need to define, store, and manage cloud-provider credentials in Codefresh.
  Obtain ID tokens from the cloud provider when needed. The ID tokens remain valid only for the duration of the workflow build and automatically expire upon completion.

* Ease of use
  Once the OIDC provider configuration is completed, obtaining the ID token is seamless.
  Our dedicated Marketplace step, the `obtain-oidc-id-token` step, when added to the pipeline, gets the ID token, without additional configuration or parameters on your part.

For details, see [OpenID Connect for Codefresh pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/oidc-pipelines/).

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: Access control for endpoints
With this feature, Codefresh admins gain enhanced control over the security of their pipelines by being able to restrict access to specific endpoint scopes.
Scopes are defined at the account level, ensuring a consistent security baseline for all pipelines. These predefined scopes are inherited by every pipeline, which Codefresh admins can override for individual pipelines when necessary.
To enable this, you need to turn on the `pipelineScopes` feature flag.

 {% include

caption="Configure scopes for pipeline"
max-width="50%"
%}

For details, see [Configure scopes for pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/pipeline-settings/#configure-pipeline-scopes).

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: Enhanced version of Cron triggers

We have extended the capabilities of Cron triggers within Codefresh pipelines for a more powerful implementation. The new functionality is available as a Beta version.

Cron triggers can now simulate Git events to enrich pipelines with repository details, include environment variables, and custom settings for caching, volume reuse, and notifications. The new settings are supported in the Codefresh UI and in the pipeline specifications.
To enable this, you need to turn on the `cronTriggersInPipelineSpec` feature flag.


{% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/aug23/rel-notes-aug23-cron-settings-tab.png"
url="/images/whats-new/aug23/rel-notes-aug23-cron-settings-tab.png"
alt="Extended settings for Cron triggers"
caption="Extended settings for Cron triggers"
max-width="40%"
%}

These additional settings are optional, so you can continue to use just the timer component of the Cron trigger.

Legacy versions of Cron triggers are flagged in the Codefresh UI and include an option to migrate them to the new version.

For details, see [Cron (timer)triggers]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/triggers/cron-triggers/) and [Cron trigger specifications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/codefresh-api/#cron-triggers).

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: Pipeline Dashboard enhancements
Review the latest enhancements in the Pipelines Dashboard.

 {% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/june23/rel-notes-june23-pipeline-dashboard-updates.png"
url="/images/whats-new/june23/rel-notes-june23-pipeline-dashboard-updates.png"
alt="Favorites filter and Last Update in Pipelines Dashboard"
caption="Favorites filter and Last Update in Pipelines Dashboard"
max-width="60%"
%}

**Filter by favorite pipelines**
The Pipelines Dashboard now has a Favorites filter. If you starred any projects or pipelines as favorites, you can easily view your favorite pipelines, both by projects or individual pipelines.

**Recent update indication**
The Last Update timestamp on the top right of the Pipelines Dashboard, refreshes automatically to show you the exact time the data was retrieved.

**Full path display for pipelines in filter**
Previously, in the Pipelines filter, it was challenging to identify the correct pipeline, when multiple pipelines shared the same name across different projects.
Now, when you mouse over a pipeline name in the list, the tooltip displays the full path, including the name of the project to which the pipeline belongs,
followed by the name of the pipeline.

For details, see [Pipelines Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/home-dashboard/#pipelines-dashboard).

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: New icons for pipeline build statuses
Pipeline builds have new status icons. With distinct icons for each status, you can easily differentiate between builds, bringing clarity and saving time. Previously, both terminated and failed builds had the same icon for example, causing confusion.

Here are the icons and the build statuses they represent:
* **Running**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-running.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Completed**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-successful.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Delayed**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-delayed.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Pending approval**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-pending-approval.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Denied approval**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-denied.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Terminating**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-terminating.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Terminated**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-terminated.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}
* **Failed**: {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../images/whats-new/june23/pipeline-build-failed-error.png" display=inline-block/> {:/}

For details, see [Viewing status for pipeline builds]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#viewing-status-for-pipeline-builds).

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: New terminal emulator
In this release, we have introduced a NEW terminal emulator for a superior user experience, featuring lightning-fast scrolling, online rendering for large logs, enhanced accessibility support, and more...

The new terminal emulator provides:
* Improved performance through GPU acceleration
* Convenient online viewing for log files, including large logs with up to 100,000 lines, avoiding the need to download the file
* Faster navigation with improved mouse support
* Improved search functionality
* Accessibility support with Screen Reader Mode

<br><br>

#### Pipelines: Configure limit for project’s pipelines
The `PROJECT_PIPELINES_LIMIT` variable allows to you set a limit for the number of pipelines in a project.
Capping the number of pipelines in a project prevents projects from becoming unwieldy and cluttered, and makes it easier to view the pipelines belonging to a project.
For details, see [Pipeline limit in projects](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#projects-pipelines-limit){:target=”\_blank”}.

<br><br>


#### GitOps: ABAC for Argo CD applications
In this release, we bring the power of ABAC for access control to GitOps for the first time as a Beta version. You can define fine-grained access to Argo CD application entities. Similar to ABAC for pipelines, access is controlled through the use of rules, created by defining teams, actions, and attributes.
To enable this, you need to turn on the `abacV2` feature flag.

 {% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/aug23/rel-notes-aug23-gitops-add-rule.png"
url="/images/whats-new/aug23/rel-notes-aug23-gitops-add-rule.png"
alt="Access control for Argo CD application entities"
caption="Access control for Argo CD application entities"
max-width="40%"
%}

For details, see [Access control for GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/gitops-abac/).

<br><br>

#### GitOps: Application Groups in GitOps Apps dashboard

Introducing a new view in the GitOps Apps dashboard, the Group view!
The Group view for GitOps applications is a simple and efficient way to streamline application deployment monitoring within your enterprise.
To enable this, you need to turn on the `gitopsAppGroups` feature flag.

 {% include
image.html
lightbox="true"
file="/images/whats-new/aug23/rel-notes-aug23-app-group-page.png"
url="/images/whats-new/aug23/rel-notes-aug23-app-group-page.png"
alt="Application Groups in GitOps Apps dashboard"
caption="Application Groups in GitOps Apps dashboard"
max-width="40%"
%}

With App Groups, you can effortlessly focus on specific app deployments, as it consolidates deployment information for all applications within the group in the same view. This feature eliminates the need to navigate between the different applications for information on them.
Tailor groupings according to the unique requirements of your organization and applications.

Codefresh also adds the Group name as an annotation to the application manifest for easy organization and management.

For details, see [Application Groups for GitOps applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/gitops-app-groups/).

<br><br>


#### GitOps: Customize session cookie
For GitOps app-proxy, when disabling concurrent sessions for `cf-api` through `DISABLE_CONCURRENT_SESSIONS`=`true`, the `CF_UUID_COOKIE_DOMAIN` environment variable allows you to customize the domain for the session cookie. For example, `.mydomain.com`.

For details, see [Customize session cookie](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#enable-session-cookie){:target="\_blank"}.

<!---
#### Frame options for Codefresh pages
We've introduced a new environment variable, `FRAME_OPTIONS`, which is now available for the `cf-api` and `cf-ui` services. This variable allows you to define the frame rendering behavior for Codefresh pages to enhance security and customization. You can control if the Codefresh page is rendered within frames of the same origin as the page or not. -->

## On-premises version 2.0.3
Welcome to our newest On-Premises release, version 2.0.3!  This major release is finally here, and it’s packed with an array of exciting usability enhancements, new features, and improvements. We listened carefully to your feedback, and worked to incorporate your suggestions into this release.

On-premises v2.0.3 comes with the exciting addition of Codefresh GitOps! Set up and deploy applications/infrastructure using Git as the single source of truth. Read the details later in this document.


### Features & enhancements

<br>

#### Upgrading to v2.0.3
In this major release, we have deprecated the `kcfi` installer.  Codefresh on-premises is now installed with Helm.
The `config.yaml` is not compatible for Helm-based installation. To use `config.yaml` in the Helm chart, you need to remove some sections and update others.

Before running the upgrade, read the details [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh/2.0.0-alpha.13#upgrading){:target="\_blank"}.

<br>

#### GitOps in Codefresh On-Premises
This version includes support for On-Premises GitOps, including an on-premises version of GitOps Runtimes.
With GitOps, Git repositories are the source-control systems that declaratively describe applications and infrastructure using code. The continuous integration and continuous delivery processes synchronize these changes with live environments, making sure that the production state always matches the desired state in Git.

Codefresh is the easiest way to get started with GitOps and Argo CD. Codefresh leverages Argo components to have the entire desired state applied from Git to your Kubernetes cluster, and then reported back to Codefresh.

For details, see [Codefresh for GitOps]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started/gitops-codefresh/) and [On-premises GitOps Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/on-prem-gitops-runtime-install/).

<br>

#### Enabling the new Codefresh experience
After installing/upgrading to version 2.0.3, Codefresh admins can **Enable the new Codefresh experience** through the Account Information option.

The new experience exposes new functionality such as [Universal Search and Navigation](#universal-search--navigation), and the [Pipelines Dashboard](#pipelines-dashboard).

Get up to speed with the navigation improvements in the new Codefresh experience.
See the [navigation quick reference]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-codefresh/menu-navigation/#classic--new-navigation) for a detailed breakdown of the navigation options. Navigations options are categorized by user options (accessed by clicking your Avatar in the toolbar), account-level administration and configuration, and features and functionality.

<br>

##### System Type in Accounts
Codefresh admins can now switch between Classic only and the unified version with both Classic and GitOps.

The **Accounts** table has a new column, System Type, that allows you to select the module for the account, as Classic or ProjectOne.

##### Settings in toolbar
We added a new **Settings** icon to the toolbar to simplify account-level management for Codefresh administrators. With the **Settings** icon always available, Codefresh admins have single-click access to account-level options and settings whenever you need.

<br>

#### Global Search & Navigation
Boost your Codefresh experience with our latest feature, Global Search & Navigation! Always available in the toolbar, Global Search & Navigation lets you get to what and where you need to in Codefresh while staying where you are.

**Search & find**
With Global Search & Navigation, you can easily monitor and find resources in your projects, pipelines, and builds, with frequently used entities organized into categories for quick search. Easily find a specific project, pipeline, or build, or browse them all.
In addition, Global Search & Navigation pulls up links to relevant information from our documentation that may be useful within your current context, making it even easier to find what you need.

**Switch accounts**
You can also switch accounts in Codefresh with Global Search & Navigation, without needing to navigate to your avatar drop-down menu. Simply search for the account, select the Switch Account action, and then choose the account you wish to switch to.
We are always adding more options, so stay tuned for announcements.

<br>

#### Pipelines Dashboard
This release introduces the much-awaited Pipelines Dashboard!  The dashboard, dedicated to pipelines and pipeline metrics, is a new experience of pipeline visibility and monitoring.
Clicking Home Dashboard located at the top of the sidebar displays the Pipelines Dashboard.
If you're currently using both GitOps and Pipelines, the Pipelines Dashboard is displayed below the GitOps and Argo Workflow dashboards.

Use the Pipelines dashboard to:
* Identify pipelines with low performance, both in terms of number of executions and execution duration
* Review the performance of a specific pipeline or project
* Compare KPIs to previous time periods to track progress
* Ensure you are meeting your SLA with your customers*

The Pipelines dashboard requires new services and databases, as listed [here](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#-new-services){:target="\_blank"}.

For details, see [Pipelines Dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/dashboards/home-dashboard/#pipelines-dashboard) in the Home Dashboard.

<br>

#### Annotations for builds
We are happy to introduce two enhancements to annotations for pipeline builds! It’s now easier than ever to find the builds you’re looking for, and customize your build views.
First, you can configure an annotation as the build's display annotation, from among the available annotations. Why would you do this? When configured, the annotation is displayed for the build in the Builds page, making it easy to see which builds share common properties like target environments.
For details, see [Configure display annotation for builds]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/annotations/#configure-annotation-to-display-for-build).

Second, you can filter builds by annotations. Filter builds by any annotation added for the build, whether it’s a display annotation or any other annotation with the Annotation filter in the Builds page.  Note that filtering builds by annotations applies only to those builds created after upgrading to v2.0.3.
For details, see [Applying filters to build views]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#applying-filters-on-the-build-view).

<br>

#### Project-based ABAC
We are excited to announce project-level Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) in this release.
ABAC for projects saves a lot of effort without compromising security as now you can control access to both project and to pipeline entities based on project tags.


* Project access to teams with project-tags
  Now you can decide which teams have access to which projects, and at which level. By adding tags to projects, you can define rules for different teams that can create, update, delete, and view projects.
  Also, read the next feature description, _Auto-create projects for teams_.

  **Migrating existing accounts**
   If you have existing accounts with team-based access control for projects, you can either migrate all accounts or a specific account, as described in [Project ABAC migration](https://github.com/codefresh-io/project-abac-migration){:target="\_blank"}.

* Pipeline access to teams with project-tags
  You can define access to pipelines on the basis of the projects that house the pipelines. Instead of tagging each pipeline, you can add tags to the project, and define rules that determine which teams can access the pipelines which share the project tags.
  Builds now honor the permissions of the pipelines. Users without access to the pipeline, will also not have access to its builds. This also means fewer email notifications, as these are only sent for builds that users have access to.

For details, see [ABAC for entities with tags and rules]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/account-user-management/access-control/#abac-for-entities-with-tags-and-rules).

<br>

#### Auto-create projects for teams
Simplify access control and setup with `Auto-create projects for teams`. Enabled by default, this global pipeline setting automatically creates projects whenever you create teams in your account.
In addition to automatically creating a project for the team, it also automatically creates a Project rule, and a Pipeline rule for the same team, with basic permissions.

For details, see [Auto-create projects for teams]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/configuration/pipeline-settings/#auto-create-projects-for-teams).

<br>

#### Selective restart for failed build steps
We added the Restart from a failed step as an option to the pipeline's Policy settings, which you can enable/disable per pipeline.
Previously, this option was available for all pipelines in the Builds page. Now, you can make it available according to the requirements of the specific pipeline. When disabled in the pipeline's settings, it is also disabled for that pipeline in the Builds page.

Why did we make this selective per pipeline?
Because restarting from a failed step is not always the answer to the problem, especially as the pipelines restarts with the same state as before.
If you have a failed Helm promotion step, and you updated the image, you would want the pipeline to use the new image. With the Restart option, the pipeline resumes execution at the same state as at the point of failure, never uses the updated image, and continues to fail.

For details, see [Policy settings for pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/pipelines/#policies) and [Restarting pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/monitoring-pipelines/#restarting-the-pipeline).

<br>

#### Multi-platform builds in Codefresh
Build and push Docker images, including multi-platform images in Codefresh with **BuildX**.

We extended the capabilities of our `build` step with the new `buildx` field. Leverage Docker’s support for multi-architecture/multi-platform support right here in Codefresh. Build an image once and reuse it on multiple architectures/platforms.
We also support custom `buildx` configurations with QEMU and Builder, giving you all the options you may need.

For details, see [Build step field descriptions]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/#fields).

<br>

#### On-demand encryption for build run variables
Manual build runs allow you to create new and modify existing variables. You can now encrypt sensitive variables on-demand, adding an extra layer of security.

For details, see [Encrypt variables for pipeline build runs]{{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#encrypt-variables-for-pipeline-build-runs).

<br>

#### Mask variables in cf_export
On the subject of variables, in our latest enhancement to `cf_export` in pipelines, we added support to mask exported variables.
You can now use the `--mask` argument to mask any sensitive variables that you export. The values of these variables are replaced with asterisks in the build logs. This ensures that sensitive information is never exposed, helping to keep your builds and pipelines secure.

For details, see [Masking variables within `cf_export`]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#masking-variables-within-cf_export).

<br>

#### Datadog integration enhancements
We enhanced our integration with Datadog to report additional information from Codefresh pipelines in Datadog.
The new information should make it even easier to monitor and analyze Codefresh pipelines in Datadog:
* For manually triggered pipelines, the name of the user who initiated the pipeline.
* The Resumed field, if the pipeline was resumed after manual approval.
* The Parameters field with user-defined variables and Git parameters.
* Error messages for pipelines with errors.

For details, see [Datadog pipeline integration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/datadog/).

<br>

#### Custom certificates
Codefresh allows configuring custom certificates for Pipelines. You can use your own trusted SSL/TLS certificates for secure communication between Codefresh and external services.

For details, see [Configure custom TLS certificates]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/on-premises/codefresh-on-prem/#configure-custom-certs-for-volumes-and-containers).

<br>

#### TLS and MTLS for Redis
Codefresh On-Premises  supports both TLS (Transport Layer Security) and MTLS (Mutual TLS) for Redis.
This enhancement provides enhanced security and encryption capabilities for Redis data communication with Codefresh in on-premises environments. Administrators can customize the level of security according to their requirements.
Using TLS and MTLS for Redis communication requires additional configuration.

For details, see [Redis with TLS](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh/2.0.0-alpha.13#external-redis){:target="\_blank"} and [Redis with MTLS](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh/2.0.0-alpha.13#external-redis-with-mtls){:target="\_blank"}.

<br>

#### Preferred date and time format selection
US and international users can  select their preferred format for date and time in the Codefresh UI. With this latest enhancement, you can now choose between US and international date formats, as well as 24 or 12-hour time formats, to best suit your needs.

Simply navigate to **User Settings** and select your preferred format.

For details, see [Customize date and time formats]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/administration/user-self-management/user-settings/#customize-date-and-time-formats).

<br>

#### SAML SSO Okta: auto-sync teams and auto-activate users
Just-in-time (JIT) user provisioning is becoming increasingly  important for IT administrators. The auto-sync and activate-user options when setting up SAML SSO settings for Okta are designed to achieve this without any manual intervention.
* **Auto-Sync** allows you to automatically sync users and teams provisioned in Okta with Codefresh at intervals you define.
* **Auto-Activate** creates and activates personal accounts for synced users in Codefresh, without the need to send an email invite and have the user click on the link.

Both options streamline the  SSO setup for SAML Okta in Codefresh, saving valuable time.

For details, see [Configure SSO settings for SAML Okta in Codefresh]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/single-sign-on/saml/saml-okta/#step-2-configure-sso-settings-for-codefresh-in-oktadefresh).

<br>

#### Runtime environment override for GitOps pipeline integrations
A GitOps pipeline integration uses the default runtime environment. After creating a GitOps pipeline integration, you can now override its runtime environment.
Codefresh uses the runtime environment for system actions such as Rollback.

<br>

#### New layout for Helm Boards
Helm Boards now display information in a horizontal layout. The new layout prevents fields with long names from overlapping with each other.

<br>

#### Builds view improvements
We are pleased to announce infrastructure changes that have significantly improved the responsiveness of the Builds page. You will now experience much faster response times when working with projects that have a large number of pipelines.

### Bug Fixes
