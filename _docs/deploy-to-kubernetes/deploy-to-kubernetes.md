## Explore your services on Kubernetes Cluster
After adding a cluster, you'll be able to manage your Kubernetes assets via the **Kubernetes tab** on the left pane. Clicking on Kubernetes icon will take you to your services dashboard.

### Access your clusters
Watch the services currently running on your clusters. You can use the filter in order to refine your view according to preferred clusters / namespaces.

You will be able to see the following parameters for each service:
* Name
* IP
* Cluster
* Namespace
* Selector

{:.text-secondary}
### Work with your services
In this view, you will be able to perform the following actions
* Add new service
* Edit/Update existing services
* Remove service

## Deploy new service

### Add service
To add a service, click the "Add Service" button.
Insert basic definitions for your new Service

{:.text-secondary}
### Select your image
You can add images built in Codefresh which were pushed to Codefresh registry, or provide a name for Docker image that will be pulled from external Docker registry.

Use the following steps in order to add Image and pull secrets from [Codefresh Registry]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/docker-registries/codefresh-registry/):
* Specify the image name in the format `r.cfcr.io/<ACCOUNT>/<IMAGE>:<TAG>`
* Provide image pull secret - this shall be done for each namespace

### To add service using K8 yaml file:
Toggle the Deployment option button to the “Advanced” position (different naming in composition, not consistent)
Copy and paste your existing K8 yaml files:
  * Service
  * Deployment

lightbox="true"

### Congratulations! Your service is now deployed to your K8 cluster!

You can update it from your Kubernetes services window - Just hit the "edit" icon and update your service using the same steps as in "Add new service" section.

## Automate your deployment
After your service is deployed to your Kubernetes cluster, you can automate image deployment using Codefresh pipelines.

Just add the following to your [pipeline definition]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/pipelines/):
{:start="1"}
1. In build step - define Docker registry to push

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/023f2ba-Screen_Shot_2017-08-01_at_12.09.31_PM.png" 
url="/images/023f2ba-Screen_Shot_2017-08-01_at_12.09.31_PM.png" 
alt="Screen Shot 2017-08-01 at 12.09.31 PM.png" 
max-width="40%" 
%}

{:start="2"}
2. Select *Kubernetes (Beta)* option in the deployment step drop down, and define desired cluster, namespace, service and branches for deployment.

{% include image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/ee8330b-Screen_Shot_2017-07-31_at_10.10.46_PM.png"

max-width="40%"
