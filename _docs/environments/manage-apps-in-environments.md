## Working with Products and applications in Environments
Environments provide visibility into which applications are running where. If you have created products for applications, environments display the products, and mo and and their associated applications. If there are no products grouping applications, the dashboard displays individual applications.

Use the Environments dashboard to:

Promote products and applications to different environments
Manage individual applications with actions like syncing, refreshing, and editing
View deployment history for applications
Compare deployed versions and dependencies across environments

## Filter applications in Environments by health status
Quickly filter applications within an Environment by health status. For health status descriptions, see [Health status for application resources]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/monitor-applications/#health-status-for-application-resources).

1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select [**Environments**](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/environments?view=compact){:target="\_blank"}.
1. For any Environment, click the Health status or statuses by which to filter.  
  The Environment displays those applications that match the selected status.

## Promote Products and applications
You have two methods for promoting a product or application from the Environments dashboard:
* **Drag-and-drop promotion**  
  Manually move a product or application from one environment to another, and define the Promotion Settings. This method is useful for quickly promoting changes between two environments to test changes, such as promoting an application from development to testing.
* **Promote action**
  Instead of drag-and-drop, select the target environment to promote to, or initiate a predefined Promotion Flow configured with promotion settings, including the action, and Pre-Action and post-action workflows. This method is best suited for structured promotions that follow defined policies.



### Drag-and-drop promotion

Drag a product or application with changes to the target environment to promote it. Customize the Promotion Settings to control promotion behavior for the environment.    
This method is best for quick promotions to test changes within a specific environment, typically in internal environments.

##### Before you begin
* Make sure you have permission to trigger promotions in the Environments dashboard


##### How to
1. In the Codfresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Environments**, and then select the environment with the product or application to promote. 
1. Drag the product or application to the desired target environment.
    * On the left, you can see Promotion Settings, either populated from global Policy settings that match the product, or left empty for you to define.  
    * The right panel displays a Compact Diff View with the files and changes to be promoted.

1. If needed, configure the Promotion Settings:
    * Select the Promotion Action as **Commit** (automated) or **Pull Request** (amy require manual approval based on organization policies). 
    * Optional. Select the **Pre-Action Workflow** to run before, and the **Post-Action Workflow** to run after, the Promotion Action.
1. Review the files with the changes.
1. Add information on the commit or PR.
1. Click **Promote**.

A release is created for the Product and the Release tab displays the ongoing deployment.



### Using the Promote action

Select the Promote option to promote a product or application to a target environment or by triggering a Promotion Flow. 
* **Target environment** (manual, configurable): Similar to drag-and-drop, this option lets you select a target environment and define the Promotion Settings before applying the promotion.
* **Promotion Flow** (predefined, automated): This option allows you to view the available Promotion Flows, including their configured environments and settings, then select a Flow to trigger. The settings are predefined and cannot be modified.

##### Before you begin
* Make sure you have permission to trigger promotions in the Environments dashboard

##### How to
1. In the Codfresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Environments**. 
1. Click the context menu of the product or application with the change to promote, and select **Promote**.

  * Select **Trigger Promotion Flow**, and click **Next**.
  * Select a Promotion Flow from the list and view the environments and promotion settings configured for the Flow.
  * Click **Trigger**. 

A release is created for the product, and the Release tab displays the ongoing deployment.








## View and compare deployed versions for dependencies
View the dependencies included with each application, and compare versions of the application and dependencies deployed in different Environments. Track the progress of the applications, understand the changes made, and ensure that customers are using the latest or most appropriate release.

**Table and YAML views**
* Table: Compare more than two applications.
* YAML: Compare up to two applications.

**Dependency chart versions**
* List the charts (dependencies) deployed with the application and the release version for each
* Compare versions of dependencies in the different applications
