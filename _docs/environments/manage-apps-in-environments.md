## Working with products and applications in environments
Environments provide visibility into which applications are running where. If you have created products to group applications, environments display the products, and their associated applications. If there are no products, the dashboard displays individual applications.

Use the Environments dashboard to:
* Promote products and applications between environments
* Manage individual applications with actions like syncing, refreshing, and editing
* View deployment history for applications
* Compare deployed versions and dependencies across environments

## Filter applications in environments by health status
Quickly filter applications within an Environment by health status. For health status descriptions, see [Health status for application resources]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/monitor-applications/#health-status-for-application-resources).

1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Environments**.
1. For any Environment, click the Health status or statuses by which to filter.  
  The Environment displays those applications that match the selected status.

## Promote products and applications
Promote a product or application from the Environments dashboard using one of two methods:
* **Drag-and-drop promotion**  
  Manually move a product or application from one environment to another, and define the Promotion Settings. Use this method to quickly test changes, such as promoting an application from development to testing.
* **Promote action**  
  Instead of drag-and-drop, select the target environment to promote to, or trigger a predefined Promotion Flow configured with promotion settings, including the action, and Pre-Action and Post-Action Workflows. This method is best for structured promotions that follow defined policies.



### Drag-and-drop promotion

Drag a product or application with changes to the target environment to promote it. Customize the Promotion Settings to control promotion behavior for the environment.    
This method is best for quick promotions to test changes within a specific environment, typically in internal environments.

##### Before you begin
* Make sure you have permissions to trigger promotions in the Environments dashboard


##### How to
1. In the Codfresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Environments**, and then select the environment with the product or application to promote. 
1. Drag the product or application to the desired target environment.
    * The Promotion Settings panel on the lest displays settings populated from global Policies that match the product, or allow you to define them.  
    * The panel on the right displays a Compact Diff View with the files and changes to be promoted.

A [release]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/product-releases/) is created for the product and its Releases tab displays the ongoing deployment.



### Using the Promote action

Use the Promote option to promote a product or application to a specific target environment or trigger a Promotion Flow. 
* **Target environment** (manual, configurable): Select the target environment and define promotion settings before applying the promotion.
* **Promotion Flow** (predefined, automated): Select a predefined Promotion Flow with configured environments and settings. The settings cannot be modified.

##### Before you begin
* Make sure you have permissions to trigger promotions in the Environments dashboard

##### How to
1. In the Codefresh UI, from the sidebar, select **Environments**. 
1. Click the context menu for the product or application, and then select **Promote**.

A [release]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/product-releases/) is created for the product and its Releases tab displays the ongoing deployment.







## View and compare deployed versions for dependencies
View the dependencies included with each application, and compare versions across environments. Track the progress of the applications, understand changes, and ensure that customers are using the latest or the most appropriate release.

**Table and YAML views**
* Table: Compare more than two applications.
* YAML: Compare up to two applications.

**Dependency chart versions**
* List the charts (dependencies) deployed with the application and the release version for each
* Compare versions of dependencies in the different applications
