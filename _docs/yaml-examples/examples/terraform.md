[Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) is a platform for *Infrastructure as Code*. It allows you to describe you cloud infrastructure in a declarative manner.

You can use Terraform to deploy to Kubernetes or any other supported cloud platform. Because Terraform itself is already offered [in a Docker container](https://hub.docker.com/r/hashicorp/terraform/), it is very easy to run Terraform in a Codefresh pipeline.

## The example Terraform project

You can see the example project at [https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/terraform-sample-app](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/terraform-sample-app). The repository contains a simple Terraform definition that creates a VM on Google cloud.

You can play with it locally after installing the `terraform` executable. 

## Prerequisites

You need to [create a Codefresh account]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/getting-started/create-a-codefresh-account/) and a Google account first. Then you need to create a [Service account Key](https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys) which will allow terraform to communicate with Google cloud.


Add your service account json as a pipeline variable called `ACCOUNT_JSON_CONTENT`. The content of this variable will be used
in order to authenticate to Google cloud.

## Create a CI/CD pipeline for Terraform

Here is the whole pipeline:

 `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - checkout
  - prepare   
  - deploy
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    stage: checkout
    type: git-clone
    repo: 'codefresh-contrib/terraform-sample-app'
    revision: master
    git: github      
  SetupAuth:
    image: alpine:3.9
    title: Setting up Google cloud auth
    stage: prepare
    commands:
      - echo $ACCOUNT_JSON_CONTENT > /codefresh/volume/account.json
      - cf_export GOOGLE_CLOUD_KEYFILE_JSON=/codefresh/volume/account.json
  DeployWithTerraform:
    image: hashicorp/terraform:0.12.0
    title: Deploying Terraform plan
    stage: deploy
    commands:
      - terraform init
      - terraform apply -auto-approve 

{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

This pipeline does the following:

1. Clones the source code with a [Git clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/git-clone/)
1. Runs [cf_export]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/#exporting-environment-variables-from-a-freestyle-step) to create a pipeline variable with the path of the google service account
1. Runs `terraform init/apply` to create the VM on Google cloud.

>For simplicity, we auto-approve the terraform plan in the example pipeline. In a production pipeline you would instead use an [approval step ]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/approval/) to inspect the plan, before actually applying it.

The pipeline needs a [single environment variable]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/pipelines/#pipeline-settings) that holds the content of the service account.

alt="Passing the Google account in the pipeline parameters"
caption="Passing the Google account in the pipeline parameters"
max-width="60%" 
%}


Run the pipeline and see your deployment succeed.


Note that in a production pipeline you should also handle the [Terraform state](https://www.terraform.io/docs/state/) in a proper manner. The example provided is using a file for [state storage](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/index.html) which is not appropriate when using Terraform in a team environment. Instead you should use one of the [storage backends](https://www.terraform.io/docs/backends/types/index.html) that support High Availability and Locking.




## Handling Pull requests

You can easily use the same pipeline or a different one for pull requests. In this case replace the `terraform apply` command with `terraform plan`. Even better, you can add an [approval step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/approval/) to allow humans to inspect the pipeline first.
