Using this repository, we'll help you get up to speed with basic functionality such as: building Docker images.

This project uses `Node JS` to build an application which will eventually become a distributable Docker image.

If your Dockerfile is not maintained in the root directory of your repository, you can specify its location relative to the root directory using the ```dockerfile``` attribute.

  `codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
version: '1.0'
steps:
  build_the_image:
    type: build
    description: Builds my service
    dockerfile: dockerfiles/Dockerfile.prod
    image_name: myuser/myservice
    tag: develop # {% raw %}${{CF_BRANCH}}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about the steps for the ```build-the-image``` command, click [HERE]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/steps/build/).

{{site.data.callout.callout_info}}
If you need to specify path to build context, you can do it through `working_directory` like in example below.\nBuild context is where we can find your Dockerfile as well as running commands. Your Dockerfile must be relative to this directory.

  `codefresh.yml`

steps:
  build_the_image:
    type: build
    description: Builds my service
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
    working_directory: {% raw %}${{main_clone}}{% endraw %}/path_build_context
    image_name: myuser/myservice
    tag: develop # {% raw %}${{CF_BRANCH}}{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
