Before making a product publicly available, you might want to restrict access to certain users. These are some options to accomplish this goal:

  - Implement custom authentication within the system
  - Configure the server to act as a proxy between the user and the application
  - Limit access to specific IP addresses

This article explains how to secure a container by exposing public ports, using an extra NGINX container to act as a proxy.

## Expose Web App Public Port

  `webapp`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '3'
services:
  web:  
    image: codefreshio/webapp
    ports:
      - "3000"
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

The architecture for this step is displayed in the diagram below. In this step example, Docker is forwarding an internal 3000 port to the host 80 port.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/a65a871-codefresh_webapp_container.png" 
url="/images/a65a871-codefresh_webapp_container.png"
alt="codefresh_webapp_container.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}

## Add NGINX Proxy
To secure the web-app we are going to specify these commands in the ```docker-compose.yml``` file.

1. Remove the port that maps from the web-app (it won't be directly accessible)
2. Add an extra NGINX container with custom configuration (proxy all traffic)
3. Configure NGINX to communicate with the web-app

  `docker-compose.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    image: ${{build-prj}}
  auth:
    image: ${{build-nginx}}
    ports:
      - 80
    links:
      - web
    environment:
      USER: ${{USERNAME}}
      PASS: ${{PASSWORD}}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
 
The architecture for the ```docker-compose.yml``` file is displayed in the diagram below.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/72a8d7a-codefresh_nginx_container.png" 
url="/images/72a8d7a-codefresh_nginx_container.png"
alt="codefresh_nginx_container.png" 
max-width="40%"
%}
