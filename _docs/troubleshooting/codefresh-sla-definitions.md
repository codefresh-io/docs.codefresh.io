## Critical impact → Urgent Priority ticket

Urgent tickets need to be created on our [Zendesk Support
system](https://support.codefresh.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) for immediate
response, with the ticket priority set to "Urgent".

Customers’ production use of our products on the application or mission-
critical systems is stopped or so severely impacted that the customer cannot
reasonably continue work.

Critical impact problems could have the following characteristics:

  * System hangs or crashes
  * Data loss or data corruption
  * Critical functionality not available
  * No reasonable workaround

Please report through support@codefresh.io for a quick turnaround.

## Major impact → High priority ticket

Important product features are unavailable with no acceptable workaround.
Customer's implementation or production use of Codefresh products in a primary
business service, major applications, or mission-critical systems are
functioning with limited capabilities or are unstable with periodic
interruptions. The software may be operating but is severely restricted.

High impact problems could have the following characteristics:

  * Product error or failure forcing a restart or recovery
  * Severely degraded performance
  * Functionality unavailable, but the system can operate in a restricted fashion.

We recommend that you file these issues through support@codefresh.io outside
of business hours. During business hours, we have coverage on Slack as well.

## Minimal impact → Normal priority ticket

Product features are unavailable, but a workaround exists, and the majority of
software functions are still useable. Minor function/feature failure that the
customer can easily circumvent or avoid. The customer's work has minor loss of
operational functionality.

Normal impact problems could have the following characteristics:

  * Error message with a workaround

  * Minimal performance degradation

  * Incorrect product behavior with a workaround

  * General requests for advice on product usage

  * Questions on product functionality or configuration during implementation

You can use support@codefresh.io to send these requests in or file them
through Slack threads.

## Low impact → Low Priority ticket

Minor problem or question that does not affect the software function. Examples
include How To's, documentation, general questions, or enhancement requests.
There is no impact on customer operations.

Low Impact problems could have the following characteristics:

  * Clarification on product documentation or release notes
  * Minor UI bugs
  * Nice to have Product enhancement requests

You can use support@codefresh.io to send these requests in or file them
through Slack threads.
