You can easily connect to external servers in Codefresh pipelines and run commands with them via SSH.

First, you need to create or find a Docker image with the SSH client. A good choice is [https://hub.docker.com/r/praqma/network-multitool](https://hub.docker.com/r/praqma/network-multitool) as it has several other networking tools inside.

Then create a freestyle step in your pipeline like this:


{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
 ssh:
   title: "Executing command over SSH"
   type: "freestyle"
   image: "praqma/network-multitool"
   commands:
     - mkdir /root/.ssh
     - echo ${{SSH_KEY}} | base64 -d > /root/.ssh/id_rsa ## Value of ${{SSH_KEY}} is base64 encoded
     - chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     - eval $(ssh-agent -s)
     - ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa
     - ssh -o "StrictHostKeyChecking no"  ${{MY_USER}}@${{MY_HOST}}
     - ssh ${{MY_USER}}@${{MY_HOST}} 'uptime'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}


The pipeline expects some [variables]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/codefresh-yaml/variables/) called `SSH_KEY, MY_USER, MY_HOST` that you can enter directly in the pipeline or fetch from [shared configuration]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/configure-ci-cd-pipeline/shared-configuration/).  

Replace `uptime`, with your own command that you want executed on the remote host.
