The GIT clone step may fail in case you have CRLF (**Windows**) end of line characters instead of LF (**Unix**).

  `Text`
{% highlight text %}
Aborting
Command [git checkout $REVISION] exited with code [1]
  [SYSTEM] Error: Failed to run git-clone step: Cloning main repository...; caused by NonZeroExitCodeError
  : Container for step title: Cloning main repository..., step type: git-clone, operation: Cloning reposit
  ory failed with exit code: 1
{% endhighlight %}

## Solution

Create a .gitattributes file in your repository (for all branches) that will enforce git to commit files with LF.
