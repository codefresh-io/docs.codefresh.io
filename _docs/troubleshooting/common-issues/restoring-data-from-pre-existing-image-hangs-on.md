## Issue

Restoring data from pre-existing image step seems to hang when starting new build for pipeline.

## Possible cause

This issue might occur when your volume size is large.

Codefresh has the unique capability of working on a single file system between different builds, by provisioning a volume per pipeline and restoring it upon starting a new build. 

If the first step seems to hang for a significant amount of time when restoring the data, this might suggest that your volume size is very big. 

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

alt="First build step hangs when starting new build - example" 
caption="First build step hangs when starting new build - example" 
max-width="60%"
%}

## Solution
Delete that volume and start from scratch.
* In the build wizard pop-up, from **Advanced Options**, select **Reset pipeline volume**.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/troubleshooting/reset-volume-for-hanging-step.png" 
url="/images/troubleshooting/reset-volume-for-hanging-step.png"
alt="Reset volume for pipeline build" 
caption="Reset volume for pipeline build" 
max-width="60%"
%}

>Reseting the pipeline volume may cause your build to take longer than usual.
