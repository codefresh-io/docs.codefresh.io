***Problem***: I want to add a private repository to Codefresh but can't find it in the repository list.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/user-settings/private-repos.png" 
url="/images/user-settings/private-repos.png"
alt="Adding private repositories" 
max-width="60%"
%}

This means that you haven’t granted Codefresh permission to access private repositories.
Click the link on the right that says "private repositories"

You can also enable the same thing from the user settings page:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/user-settings/allow-private-repositories.png" 
url="/images/user-settings/allow-private-repositories.png"
alt="Allow private repositories" 
max-width="70%"
%}




> For some Git providers you will be redirected to the provider’s permission page.
