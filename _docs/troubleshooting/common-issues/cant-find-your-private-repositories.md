## Issue
I want to add a private repository to Codefresh but can't find it in the repository list.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/troubleshooting/private-repos.png" 
url="/images/troubleshooting/private-repos.png"
alt="Adding private repositories" 
caption="Adding private repositories" 
max-width="60%"
%}

## Possible cause
This means that you haven’t granted Codefresh permission to access private repositories.

## Solution
Click the link on the right that says "private repositories".

You can also enable the same thing from the user settings page:

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/troubleshooting/allow-private-repositories.png" 
url="/images/troubleshooting/allow-private-repositories.png"
alt="Allow private repositories" 
caption="Allow private repositories" 
max-width="70%"
%}


> Some Git providers redirect you to the provider’s permission page.
