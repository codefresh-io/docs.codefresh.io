# Account invitation not permitting login

#

## Overview

  1. Accepting an invite does not allow you to access the inviting account.
  2. Accepting an invite does not work, and fails to let you log in.

## Details

The account is not correctly linked.

  1. Ensure that the email account you're logging in with is the same as the email address used for the invite.
  2. Log out of any previous sessions with the relevant identity provider and if need be, try a different browser or a private/incognito window.
  3. If you are able to log in but don't see the inviting account, your user may be under multiple accounts. If this is the case, you can switch between available accounts via the user menu drop-down in the upper right-hand corner.

_Notes_ In the event that this issue persists, please [contact our support
team](https://support.codefresh.io/hc/en-us/requests/new) with as many details
as you have.
