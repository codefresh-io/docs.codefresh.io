### In Codefresh

1. Go to Account settings > Single Sign On

    - **IDP Entry**: type in any character
    - **Application Cert**: type in any character
1. Save
1. Click Edit, and we will come back for the information

1. Select Custom SAML
1. Add a Display Label (can be what you want)

    1. **IDP Entity ID**: On the Codefresh side, this is the Client Name
        - Example: gujNGnhXTSmK
        - Make sure there is no space in front when copy and pasting
    1. **SP Entity ID**: g.codefresh.io
    1. **ACS URL**: On the Codefresh side, this is the Assertion URL
        - Also known as the callback URL
    1. **Login URL**: On the Codefresh side, this is the Assertion URL without the /callback
    1. **IDP URL**: Can add a custom name at the end or leave it as default
    1. **Attributes**: add the following
        - **email**: email
        - **firstName**: firstname

1. **Application Certificate**: Copy and paste the information from the Certificate we downloaded.
    - **Note**: you will get a warning when editing the Certificate section
    - You can use with or without the `-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----` and `-----END CERTIFICATE-----` as long the Certificate data is there

1. Go to Account Settings > User & Teams
1. Locate a test user
1. On the SSO Column, select the SSO name to enable SSO for the user
1. In a different browser or private/incognito browser window use the Corporate option to log in
