## What are promotion hooks?

Promotion hooks in Codefresh GitOps are specialized workflows that run at key points during a promotion release. A promotion release is created when a Promotion Flow is manually or automatically triggered.   
Promotion hooks are implemented using the same underlying mechanism as standard Promotion Workflows, but run with additional context and scopeâ€”on releases and environments. 

Unlike Pre- and Post-Action Promotion Workflows, which run in specific environments and target individual applications, promotion hooks run at the release or environment level. They are not tied to a particular deployment or application, and enable real-time alerts, custom logic and actions without requiring users to monitor the promotion directly in the UI. This allows teams to stay informed and take action instantly as promotions progress.

##### When are promotion hooks triggered?  
Promotion hooks can run at different stages of a release:  
* **Release start**: When a release is initiated.  
* **Release end**: When a release completes, whether **successful** or **failed**.  
* **Per environment**: When a release transitions through specific environments:  
  * **On start**: When the promotion reaches an environment.  
  * **On success**: When the promotion completes successfully in an environment.  
  * **On failure**: When the promotion fails in an environment.  

##### Use cases for promotion hooks
* Auditing and visibility  
  Capture details on the entire promotion release and take action

* Notifications and reporting 
  Get timely alerts and notifications on success and failures alike through familiar channels. Send alerts to Slack, email, or monitoring tools based on release events to be always in the loop instead of having to constantly monitor the promotion release.

* Integration with external tools
  Automate updates to ticketing systems such as Jira, or observability platforms.  

##### Requirements for promotion hooks

* Service account
* Service account role and role binding 
* Promotion context

## Promotion hooks vs. Pre- and Post-Action Promotion Workflows

The table lists key differences between Promotion Workflows containing hooks and Promotion (Pre- and Post-Action) Workflows.

| **Feature**    | **Promotion Hooks**  | **Promotion Workflows**    |
|----------------|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**    | Provide information on the release  | Provide information on promoted changes in applications within an environment    |
| **Execution**  | Runs run at release start, end (success, failure), or per environment (start, success, failure) | Runs for each application in an environment before and after promotion |
| **Scope**      | Runs on cluster at release or environment level      | Runs per application in the environment |
| **Effect on promotion**  | ??? | Blocks a promotion if conditions fail  |



## Promotion hooks in Shared Configuration Repository
Promotion Workflows with hooks are saved in the Shared Configuration Repository of the Runitme designated as the Configuration Runtime.
If you have multiple Configuration Runtimes, the hooks are saved in the first Configuration Runtime in the list

## Service accounts & service account roles for Promotion Hook Workflows
When a GitOps Runtime is installed, to support promotion hooks, Codefresh GitOps creates the following resources:  

* **Service account**  
  * `cf-default-promotion-workflows-sa` service account with the required role and role binding.  
  * Workflow template manifests in Codefresh reference this service account.  

* **Service account role**
  `cf-default-promotion-workflows-role`, the default role for Promotion Workflows, bound to the service account `cf-default-promotion-workflows-sa`.  

If you already have service accounts or want to create your own service accounts, make sure that the system-provided service account is not compromised.


### RBAC permissions for service account role  
The following Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) permissions are required:   
* `GET`  
* `WATCH`  
* `PATCH`  

These permissions allow hooks to retrieve and update release and promotion details securely. 

### Using an existing service account
For existing service accounts:
* Create a new role with the required RBAC permissions.
* Add a role binding to associate the new role with the service account.


### Creating a new service account.
* Bind the `cf-default-promotion-workflows-role` to the new service account.


## Promotion contexts for promotion hooks
All promotion hooks receive a standard set of [default arguments](#default-arguments-in-promotion-hook-workflows) such as the release ID, product, commit SHA.  
To expose custom data such as Jira ticket IDs, approver names, or Slack channels, and make this data available to additional promotion hooks in the same Promotion Flow, you must define a **promotion context**.
A promotion context is a user-defined JSON object passed between hooks in the same Promotion Flow. It enables the sharing values that Codefresh does not access by default.  

Unlike standard Promotion Workflows which have built-in access to internal context, promotion hooks run within GitOps Runtimes in your own clusters. These hooks do not automatically receive custom values unless you define them in a promotion context. 

Promotion contexts allow you to:
* Expose and store user-defined variables that Codefresh cannot natively access.
* Make those variables available as input parameters to subsequent Promotion Hook Workflows in the same Promotion Flow.

Examples:
* Send a Slack alert to a specific channel by passing the channel name in the promotion context
* Link to a Jira ticket across all hooks in the release by storing the ticket ID in the context


### Creating and exporting a promotion context 

Create a promotion context in a Promotion Workflow as a JSON object including the custom parameters, and the file to which to export or save it and export the promotion context an output parameter to pass to subsequent Promotion Hook Workflow


1. **Create the promotion context**  
  * Create the promotion context as a JSON object containing the:
      * Input parameters as variables
      * File to which to save the promotion context. The file is referenced as the promotion context source.

  **Example:**  
  The example creates a promotion context `PROMOTION_CONTEXT` as a JSON object passed to subsequent promotion hooks in the same Promotion Flow. 
  The promotion context:
  * Defines `JIRA_ISSUE_SOURCE_FIELD` and makes it available an input parameter to subsequent hooks.
  * Writes the context to a file `/tmp/promotion-context.txt`
  
```yaml 
...
spec:
...
    - name: set-promotion-context
      serviceAccountName: hook
      inputs:
        parameters:
          - name: JIRA_ISSUE_SOURCE_FIELD
          - name: JIRA_BASE_URL
      script:
        image: alpine
        command:
          - sh
        source: |
            export JIRA_ISSUE_BASE_URL="{{inputs.parameters.JIRA_BASE_URL}}"
            export JIRA_ISSUE_SOURCE_FIELD="{{inputs.parameters.JIRA_ISSUE_SOURCE_FIELD}}"
            PROMOTION_CONTEXT=$(echo "{\"JIRA_ISSUE_URL\": \"${JIRA_ISSUE_BASE_URL}/browse/${JIRA_ISSUE_SOURCE_FIELD}\"}")
            echo "$PROMOTION_CONTEXT" > /tmp/promotion-context.txt
...
``` 

1. **Export promotion context**  
  Expose the file with the promotion context as an output parameter to make it available to promotion mechanism.
  * Add `PROMOTION_CONTEXT` as the `name` to `outputs.parameters`. _The name must not be changed_.
  * Add the `globalName` attribute to make it available globally. The value must be identical to the name of the promotion context.
  * `valueFrom` attribute to reference the file path

  **Example:** The example adds `PROMOTION_CONTEXT` to `outputs.parameters.name`,  defines `globalName` as the name of the promotion context, and specifies the file path where the promotion context JSON was saved for Codefresh GitOps to retrieve and pass on to subsequent Promotion Hook Workflows.

```yaml 
...
spec:
...
      outputs:
        parameters:
          - name: PROMOTION_CONTEXT  # cannot be changed
            globalName: PROMOTION_CONTEXT # name of promotion context
            valueFrom:
              path: /tmp/promotion-context.txt
...
``` 






## Examples of Promotion Hook Workflows
The following examples of Promotion Hook Workflows 

TBD


## Assigning promotion hooks in Promotion Flows

Assign Promotion Workflows with promotion hooks in the Promotion Flow for the release or environments:
* Release-level hooks run before the trigger environment and after the final target environment
* Environment-level hooks run on entry to or exit from each environment

  >**NOTE**  
  You cannot assign a Promotion Hook Workflow to the Trigger Environment itself. 


SCREENSHOT TBD

## How promotion hooks work during execution

Once you assign Promotion Workflows with promotion hooks in a Promotion Flow, Codefresh GitOps executes them automatically at the relevant stages of the Promotion Flow:

**Triggering the first hook**
When the Promotion Flow is triggered, the promotion mechanism:
* Passes the default promotion metadata (e.g., release ID, commit SHA)
* Initializes the promotion context, if defined and valid, with any custom values 

**Triggering subsequent hooks**
As the Flow progresses, the promotion mechanism:
* Retrieves the promotion context with the custom variables stored in the first hook
* Passes the context automatically to all subsequent hooks as input parameters, making user-defined values consistently available across the entire flow, regardless of environment or cluster

For example, if a Jira ticket ID is defined in the context when a promotion starts, itâ€™s accessible later when a post-promotion hook runs in a different environment or cluster.
