After creating products and environments, you can initiate promotions and track releases. 

Enhance your promotion strategies with these advanced configuration options:
* Multi-environment promotion with [Promotion Flows]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/promotion-flow/) (only account admins)
* Conditional promotions with [Promotion Policies]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/promotion-policy/) (only account admins)
* Automatic validations and gates with [Promotion Workflows]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/promotion-workflow/)
* Versioning, properties for promotion, flows and triggers, with [Product Settings]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/product-promotion-props/)

If you are more comfortable with YAML, see our [YAML specification examples]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/yaml/) for the same.
