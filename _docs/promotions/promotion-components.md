  <tr>
    <td><strong>Environments (Required)</strong></td>
    <td>Environments are where your applications live and promotions happen. Typically, environments reflect your software lifecycle and deployment stages. You need at least two environments:
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Trigger environment</strong>: Where a change starts the promotion flow, initiated by a manual commit or pull request.</li>
        <li><strong>Target environments</strong>: The environments where changes are promoted after the trigger environment.</li>

  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Product (Optional)</strong></td>
    <td>A Product in GitOps groups related applications into a single entity. This simplifies promotions by allowing you to promote the entire Product and all its applications across different environments, rather than managing applications individually.</td>
    <td>Users with ABAC permissions</td>
    <td><a href="#">Link</a></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Applications</strong></td>
    <td>Applications are the core units around which promotions revolve. Each application can be promoted individually or as part of a product.</td>

    <td><strong>Promotion Flows</strong></td>
    <td>Promotion flows orchestrate the movement of applications through environments, ensuring a controlled and automated promotion process.</td>

    <td><a href="#">Link</a></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Promotion Settings</strong></td>
    <td>Promotion settings specify what gets promoted across environments. If using a Product, these settings can be defined within the Productâ€™s configuration or in a YAML CRD.</td>
    <td>Users with ABAC permissions</td>
    <td><a href="#">Link</a></td>
  </tr>
  
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Promotion Policy</strong></td>
    <td>A Promotion Policy outlines the actions taken when changes are promoted. It ensures that the target environment is ready for promotion, with workflows to validate the environment both before and after the promotion action, like commits or pull requests.</td>
    <td>Account administrators</td>
    <td><a href="#">Link</a></td>

## Promotion entites and GitOps Runtimes

All promotion entities are stored as part of GitOps Runtimes in the Shared Configuration Repository. Depending on wheyjr are required across all runtimes and clusters or specific runtimes and clusters.
