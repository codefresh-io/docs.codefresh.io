If you are new to promotions in GitOps, you may find it useful to review the entities involved in the promotion process, and their roles.  
There are the core entities that define the structure of your development deployment lifecyles, and promotion-specific entities, which are advanced entities each dedicated to a different aspect of the promotion process. 

For a complete end-to-end continuous delivery with Codefresh GitOps promotions, see [Promotions: End-to-end guide]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/create-promotion-sequence/). 

## Building blocks

A promotion sequence comprises several building blocks, optional and required, each serving a specific role in the promotion and deployment process.
The table describes the core and promotion-specific entities.

    <td colspan="4"><strong>Core entities</strong><br>These entities define the structure of your deployment.<br>Core entities support standard promotion flows, allowing you to trigger promotions that cover typical deployment scenarios. You can initiate manual promotions between two environments using drag-and-drop and other options.

    <td colspan="4"><strong>Promotion building blocks</strong><br>These entities are purpose-built for promotions and support advanced scenarios by enabling complex, multi-environment promotion flows with precise definitions and control. Promotion building blocks allow you to orchestrate multi-environment promotion processes, define exactly what gets promoted, and set specific conditions for each promotion. For example, you can quickly set up automated promotion flows, integrate tests and policies, and enforce governance over each promotion stage, giving you total control over how promotions are executed across your environments.</td>

## Promotion entities and GitOps Runtimes

Most of the core and promotion-specific entities are stored as Custom Resource Definitions (CRDs) in the Shared Configuration Repository of the GitOps Runtime designated as the [Configuration Runtime]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/monitor-manage-runtimes/#designating-configuration-runtimes). 
If you have more than one Configuration Runtime, Codefresh automatically consolidates the settings into a single set of promotion manifests.

>**NOTE**  
In the documentation, we use Shared Configuration Repository or Shared Config Repo for clarity.  
In code samples and internal references, it is represented as `isc`.
