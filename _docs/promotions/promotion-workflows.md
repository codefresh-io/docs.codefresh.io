Promotion Workflows validate the readiness of target environments for promotion. They are configured as part of Promotion Policies which are activated when promotions are triggered for products.  

In structure and behavior, a Promotion Workflow is essentially an Argo Workflow, classified as a Promotion Workflow. To classify and utilize an Argo Workflow or a Workflow Template as a Promotion Workflow, it must include the annotation attribute `metadata.annotations: codefresh.io/workflow-origin: promotion` in its manifest. 
See [Key features of Promotion Workflows](#key-features-of-promotion-workflows) and [Create Promotion Workflows](#create-promotion-workflows).

After creating Promotion Workflows, there are two aspects to working with them:
1. Managing Promotion Workflows  
  Managing Promotion Workflows involves controlling the configuration of the manifest, creating new Promotion Workflows by copying existing ones, and removing workflows that are no longer needed or relevant.  
  See [Managing Promotion Workflows](#managing-promotion-workflows).

1. Managing Workflow execution instances  
  Workflow execution instances represent specific occurrences when a Promotion Workflow is triggered either as part of a Promotion Policy, or run for validation. These instances provide detailed insights into the performance and execution of the specific instance of the Workflow.
  See [Managing Workflow instances](#managing-workflow-instances). 




## Key features of Promotion Workflows

##### Annotation attribute
An Argo Workflow or a Workflow Template is classified as a Promotion Workflow only when the following annotation is present in the workflow manifest:  
`metadata.annotations: codefresh.io/workflow-origin: promotion`

This annotation in the Promotion Workflow's manifest ensures that:
* The Promotion Workflow appears in the Promotion Workflows list and can be managed there
* You can assign the Promotion Workflow to Promotion Policies
* Select it when creating Promotion Flows
See [Create Promotion Workflows](#create-promotion-workflows).

##### Pre- and Post-Action Workflows
A Promotion Workflow is run as part of a Promotion Policy, and can be executed before or after the Promotion Action as a Pre-Action or a Post-Action Workflow. The Promotion Action is the action that implements the changes to the environment, for example, commit.
TBD - maybe add examples

##### Pre-commit dry run validation 
Inline validations when creating or editing Promotion Workflows are supplemented by dry-run validations. Instead of committing the manifest and detecting errors or failures when the Workflow is activated, the Run option allows you to test and validate parameters with different values at any time.
See [Validate Promotion Workflow parameters](#validate-promotion-workflow-parameters)

##### Post-Action Workflow arguments
Codefresh passes parameters generated by the commit action to a Post-Action Workflow. These arguments allow you to customize Post-Action Workflow execution based on the specific details of the commit. 
See [Arguments in Post-Action Workflows](#arguments-for-post-action-workflows)

## Create Promotion Workflows

Create a Promotion Workflow from scratch, use the base Promotion Workflow Template, or use one of the predefined Promotion Workflows in Codefresh.

Whichever method you use to create your Promotion Workflow, make sure you include the annotation in the manifest to classify and use it as a Promotion Workflow.


1. In the Codefresh UI, from Promotions in the sidebar, select [Promotion Workflows](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/?????){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Click **Add Promotion Workflow**.
1. Define the following:
  1. **Name**: The name of the Promotion Workflow.<br>The name must be unique in the cluster, and must match Kubernetes naming conventions. 
  1. **Description** : The intended use of the Promotion Workflow.<br>The description is added as an annotation to the YAML file. It is also displayed in the Promotion Workflows list in the UI. 
  1. **Resource Filename**: The name of the YAML resource file with the configuration settings for the Promotion Workflow, by default, identical to the Name of the Promotion Workflow. You can change as needed.

{:start="4"}
1. Click **Add**.
1. Select **Blank Skeleton File** and click **Next**.
  The YAML is displayed on the right populated with the settings you defined.

SCREENSHOT 
1. Note the instructions at the top of the YAML file.
1. If needed, change `metadata.annotations.version`.
  The version is displayed in the Promotion Workflows list in the UI.
  You should update it manually when there are changes.
1. To test the Promotion Workflow with the current settings before committing the changes, click **Run**.
?????
1. Make any updates needed.
1. Commit the changes.

When the YAML file is synced to the cluster, it is displayed in the Promotion Workflows list.


### Arguments for Pre-Action and Post-Action Workflows


The table describes the parameters with default values passed to Pre- and Post-Action Workflows.  
Some parameters are passed to both types of Promotion Workflows, while some parameters are specific only to Post-Action Workflows.  
The same set of parameters are passed also for pull requests, after the pull request is merged.

At the simplest levels, you can display the details from the parameters in notifications. In more advanced scenarios, you can customize the Workflow execution based on specific parameters.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
| Parameters                     | Description            | Passed in<br>Pre- or Post-Action Workflow | 
| --------------           | --------------           |  
|`APP_NAME`      | The name of the specific application the Promotion Workflows and the Promotion Action pertain to. For example, `trioapp-staging`.| Pre- and Post-Action Workflows |
|`APP_NAMESPACE` | The namespace where the application is deployed to. For example, `gitops`. | Pre- and Post-Action Workflows |
| `REPO_URL`     | The Git repository with the application settings, as defined in the application's configuration. See [Source settings for applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/#sources).| Pre- and Post-Action Workflows |
| `PATH`         |  The relative path within the repository defined by `REPO_URL` to the directory or file containing the application's configuration. See [Source settings for applications]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/create-application/#sources). | Pre- and Post-Action Workflows |
| `BRANCH`       | The specific Git branch to which to promote changes. For example, `main`.   | Pre- and Post-Action Workflows |

## Promotion Workflow list

All Argo Workflows which include `metadata.annotations: codefresh.io/workflow-origin: promotion` are displayed in the Promotion Workflows list.

SCREENSHOT

The Description and Version information are retrieved from the manifest if these are specified there.

The Promotion Workflows list is also the centralized location from which you can manage both Workflows and Workflow instances. See [Managing Promotion Workflows](#managing-promotion-workflows) and [Managing Workflow instances](#managing-workflow-instances).

## Managing Promotion Workflows
After you create a Promotion Workflow, you can:
* Optimize the manifest by updating steps or refining the logic to better suit evolving requirements
* Locally validate the current version of the manifest with different values for parameters
* Copy and delete Promotion Workflows
  


### Update Promotion Workflow manifests
Update and optimize the Promotion Workflow manifest including steps, actions, and parameters, to adapt to changing requirements.  
When triggered, the Promotion Workflow uses the current version of the manifest, ensuring that the Workflow execution instance always uses the latest configurations and optimizations.

You can:
* Toggle between the Git State, Desired State, and Live State
* Render Diff views of all three states
* Update manifest

Changes to the manifest do not affect past execution instances as the manifest is updated independently of individual workflow executions.


##### How to
1. In the Codefresh UI, from Promotions in the sidebar, select [Promotion Workflows](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/?????){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Do one of the following:
  * From the context menu of the Promotion Workflow select **Edit**.
  * Click the name of the Promotion Workflow.
1. In the Manifest tab, do any of the following:
  * Identify **Errors** or **Warnings** if any. 
  * To make changes, make sure **Git State** is selected and then click **Edit**.
  * To view the differences between the three states, click **Diff View**, and toggle between **Full** and **Compact** views.

### Validate Promotion Workflow parameters  


When you create a Promotion Workflow or modify the manifest of an existing workflow, you can validate the new workflow or the changes made before committing them to Git.  
The Run option supplements the automatic inline validations, allowing you to change parameter values and confirm that the workflow behaves as expected.


1. In the Codefresh UI, from Promotions in the sidebar, select [Promotion Workflows](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/?????){:target="\_blank"}.
1. Click the name of the Promotion Workflow to validate.
1. Click **Run** at the top-right.
   Codefresh displays the parameters passed in the Promotion Workflow. 

1. Modify as needed.
1. Click **Run** at the bottom of the form.
???


### Copy Promotion Workflows
Copy an existing Promotion Workflow to create a new Promotion Workflow with the same manifest configuration. (NIMA: when would you do this)

1. In the Codefresh UI, from Promotions in the sidebar, select [Promotion Workflows](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/?????){:target="\_blank"}.
1. From the context menu of the Promotion Workflow select **Copy**.
1. Enter the **Name**, **Description**, and **Resource Filename** for the new Workflow.
1. Update the manifest if needed.
1. Commit the changes.





### Delete Promotion Workflows
Delete unused legacy Promotion Workflows. Deleting a Promotion Workflow removes it from the Promotion Workflow list, from the Promotion Policies it is configured in, and from the Promotion Flows. 

1. In the Codefresh UI, from Promotions in the sidebar, select [Promotion Workflows](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/?????){:target="\_blank"}.
1. From the context menu of the Promotion Workflow select **Delete**.
1. Enter the name of the Promotion Workflow to confirm.
1. Optional. Add a commit message and description.
1. To confirm, click **Commit & Delete**.


## Managing Workflow instances
Workflow instances are the specific execution instances of the Promotion Workflow. 

You can:
* View instances of a Promotion Workflow
* Analyze the version of the manifest used for the instance with the configuration, parameters, artifacts (Workflow summary)
* Resubmit a completed or failed workflow (Workflow actions)
* Delete an instance (Workflow actions)
* Analyze individual steps of the workflow (Workflow steps)
* View detailed logs to troubleshoot execution (Workflow logs)

### Workflow summary

The Workflow Summary presents modular information for the selected Workflow instance. 

SCREENSHOT

The table highligts key information you can find in the Summary tab for a workflow.

{: .table .table-bordered .table-hover}
|  Workflow Summary    | Description                   | 
| --------------       | ------------------------------|  
| **Errors**               | Displayed when the Workflow instance has at least one failed step.   |  
| **Summary**              | Namespace, memory and CPU resource usage, and execution context of the workflow.<br>If triggered by a parent workflow, displays the link to that workflow.|  
| **Manifests**            | The version of the manifest used for the specific Workflow execution. This may not be the same version currently displayed in the Manifest tab. Useful to troubleshoot failed steps and errors in the execution instance. |  
| **Labels**            | Labels assigned to the workflow. Useful to filter, search, organize workflow executions. <br>Examples:<br>`codefresh.io/app-name: trioapp-qa`, `codefresh.io/app-namespace: gitops`.| 
| **Parameters**            | The inputs set/modified for the specific execution. <br>Examples:<br>`Threshold: 50`, `Nb: 100`.| 
| **Artifacts**            | The outputs if any generated by a workflow step, and can be logs, test-reports, binaries or any other type of file. Each artifact is associated with a specific step in the workflow. For example: `main-logs: smoketests-k9ss6`.| 



###  Workflow actions
Depending on the status of the workflow instance, you can do the following: 

* **Resubmit**: Rerun or re-execute the Workflow. Resubmitting a Workflow, creates a new instance of the Workflow.  You can resubmit both successful and failed workflows.
* **Delete**: Remove unused or legacy workflow instances. Deleting a workflow instance removes it from the list of executions. The Promotion Workflow itself is not changed.

### Workflow steps
Visualize the steps in the Workflow. For additional information on the step, click the step to open the pull-out panel.

SCREENSHOT

* The header displays the name of the step, its status, the step-type, the date of the most recent update, and duration.  
* The tabs displayed differ according to the step type:  
  * The Summary, Manifest, Containers, Inputs, Outputs tabs are displayed for all almost all step types. (NIMA: what about Artifacts??)
  * The Logs tab is displayed for Pod step types.
  * Event-step types display Manifest, Summary, and Payload.
    For Cron and Unknown event types, only the Event Sources are shown. 


### Workflow logs
View online logs for ongoing or completed Workflows. As with logs in any standard terminal, you can copy/cut/paste log info. The commands differ based on the OS.

SCREENSHOT

  * For an ongoing Workflow, view live logs for steps as they are being executed.  
  * For a completed Workflow, view logs for the Workflow, or for any step in the workflow.  

NIMA: Ask about archived workflows.
