Promotions are a key component of the continuous delivery (CD) process, enabling teams to control how software moves through various environments based on automated triggers or manual inputs. 

Codefresh GitOps supports automated promotion sceanrios tailored to various deployment models through Promotion Flows, triggered on predefined criteria, such as specific commit messages or changes in Git branches, allowing seamless and consistent updates across environments. See [Creating Promotion Flows](#{{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/promotion-flow/).  

Recognizing that some scenarios require on-demand control, Codefresh also provides manual promotion triggers to handle specific needs. Whether deploying a hotfix to production, promoting an entire product release, or testing code changes in a targeted environment, manual promotion options offer flexibility to meet these demands.

Manual promotion triggers provide different levels of control, accessible from distinct areas of the platform, enabling:

* **Single-environment promotion**  
  Useful for quick promotion to a specific environment through the drag-and-drop option, or the promote option for more control on promotion behavior for traget the environment
* **Multi-environment promotion**  
  Designed for promotion across multiple environments through predefined flows, with the promote product via Promotion Flow flow, and the option to trigger a promotion for any product directly from within a Promotion Flow.

## Manually trigger promotions through drag-n-drop
Drag-and-drop the product to the target environment to promote changes, and customize the Promotion Settings to control promotion behavior for the environment.    
This method is useful to test changes within a specific environment. For example, QA teams wanting to test changes in staging or other internal environments.

##### How to
1. From the sidebar in the Codefresh UI, select **Environments**, and then select the environment with the product to promote. 
1. Drag the product to the desired target environment.
  On the left, the Promotion Settings are either populated from global Policy settings that match the product, or left empty for you to define.  
  On the right, you can see the Compact diff view, displaying the files with the changes and the changes to be promoted.
