A promotion flow is a structured sequence of actions that automates the promotion of changes in products through various environments until deployment. It ensures that code changes are automatically, systematically, and consistently moved, from development to production environments, enhancing the reliability and efficiency of deployments.

We have a specialized Promotion Flow entity in Codefresh, dedicated to creating and managing multi-environment promotions.
Promotion Flows in Codefresh GitOps, backed by the power of Argo CD, streamlines the process of moving code changes through different stages, minus all the manual work of custom scripting to manage environment-specific requirements. 

Set up completely automated promotion flows with just a few clicks, and at the same time, govern how promotions should happen in different environments.

Review [key insights](#promotion-flow-behavior-key-insights) to understand promotion flow behavior before creating your first Promotion Flow. 






## Flow Builder vs. YAML
You can create Promotion Workflows through the Flow Builder, a graphical interface, or through a YAML Custom Resource Definition (CRD).  
The Flow Builder visually guides you through creating any type of Promotion Flow. See [Create a Promotion Flow](#create-a-promotion-flow).

Once configured and committed, Promotion Flow settings are saved as a CRD (Custom Resource Definition) within the Shared Configuration Repository in the GitOps Runtime selected as the Configuration Runtime.  
The path in the Shared Configuration Repo is `<gitops-runtime>/<shared-configuration-repo>/resources/configurations/promotion-flows`.  
See [Shared Configuration Repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/shared-configuration/) and [Designating Configuration Runtimes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/monitor-manage-runtimes/#designating-configuration-runtimes).  



## Sequential vs. parallel promotions

Model your Promotion Flows to suit the unique requirements of any deployment process with sequential or parallel promotions.

* **Sequential promotions**  
  Sequential flows are linear, where changes are promoted from the previous to the next environment in the order in which they are defined.
  This is the more common and traditional kind of Promotion Flow, where you start the flow from a trigger environment, usually the development environment, and then promote to the other target environments in succession.  

* **Parallel promotions**  
  In a parallel flow, changes are promoted across multiple environments simultaneously. This design is ideal when environments serve distinct purposes or when they can be updated independently without risk to other environments, such as promoting changes to multiple regional clusters that do not have cross-dependencies.
  Parallel promotions are useful in multi-region setups, where you may want to promote changes to several regions before the final production environment. 



 
## Promotion Flow behavior: Key insights
Here are a few useful factors to be aware of when creating Promotion Flows.  


### Trigger and target environments 
You can create and assign environments for the Promotion Flow, starting with the Trigger Environment, where the change to the application initiates the flow, and the other target environments required for promotion. You need at least one target environment for promotions. 


##### Adding environments  
When adding an environment, you can select from the list of available environments, or create a new one that takes you to the Environments page for defining settings.  At this point, the Promotion Flow remains unsaved. A notification alerts you that there are unsaved changes to the Promotion Flow. This notification remains as long as you have unsaved changes in the Promotion Flow. 

##### Removing environments
You can remove an environment from the Promotion Flow, and decide how to reconnect next environments if any, to previous environments.  

Reconnecting environments is only relevant when there are one or more environments in the flow _following_ the one being removed. If the environment you’re removing, for example `staging` is the final environment in the flow, you can remove it directly without needing to reconnect. 

See [Remove environments from Promotion Flows](#remove-environments-from-promotion-flows).

### Applications in environments

##### Applications in Trigger Environment
It is recommended to have a single application for a product in the Trigger Environment. If the product has multiple applications with changes, changes are promoted only for a single application. <!--- NIMA: which app is selected? the one with the most recent change? 

##### Applications per defined environment
The product must include an application in each environment defined in the Promotion Flow. Otherwise the promotion will fail.

##### Multiple applications in a target environment
If a target environment, such as staging or production, contains multiple applications for the same product, segmented for example by region, tenant, or other criteria, each application in that environment is updated with changes from the source environment. 

While this behavior may seem intuitive, it’s important to understand that each set of Promotion Policy settings that govern the environment's promotion settings, _also applies individually to each application_.

For example, if there are three applications with Pre-Action Workflows, the Pre-Action Workflow will execute three times—once per application.
Execution of steps within the Pre-Action Workflow that create a resource or perform an action are also multiplied accordingly.  
Consider a step within the Pre-Action Workflow which creates a JIRA ticket upon initiating promotion. The step will run thrice, creating three separate JIRA tickets.

##### Deleting/adding files in applications

Adding or deleting files from applications in target environments does not impact the success of the Promotion Flow. The promotion mechanism simply retains the added/deleted files as they are in the target environments.



### Dependencies between environments

A dependency in a Promotion Flow is a direct relationship between two or more environments, where one environment’s promotion depends on the successful promotion of changes in another environment. Changes cannot be promoted to the dependent environment until the preceding one is successfully promoted.

By default, a dependency is automatically established between the trigger environment and its immediate target environment in a sequential flow. Add dependencies between environments when the success of one environment is essential for the promotion to the next. 

The arrows between the environments in the example below indicate the dependencies between environments.

alt="Simple sequential flow with dependencies between each environment" 
caption="Simple sequential flow with dependencies between each environment"
max-width="60%"
%}

Here's an example of a Promotion Flow with multiple dependencies between target environments.

url="/images/gitops-promotions/promotion-flow/multi-region-dependency.png"
alt="Multiple dependencies between two target environments" 
caption="Multiple dependencies between two target environments"
max-width="60%"
%}


##### Differentiating dependencies from parallel environments
In flows with parallel target environments, promotions to the parallel environments occur simultaneously. Unlike dependencies, each parallel target environment is updated independently of the others. 

In the example below, changes are promoted to `production` as soon as promotion for `staging` has completed successfully (dependency), without waiting for `prod-asia` and `prod-us` (parallel).

alt="Dependencies vs. parallel promotions in target environments" 
caption="Dependencies vs. parallel promotions in target environments"
max-width="60%"
%}




### Promotion Policy settings

For each environment, you can explicitly set the Promotion Policy that defines governs promotion behavior for the environment through the Promotion Action (required), and the optional Pre- and Post-Action Workflows.  
You can also preview Policy settings by product before the flow is triggered. 

##### Inline vs. global Promotion Policy settings

When you create or edit a Promotion Flow, the Flow Builder displays available policy settings. 

* **Inline policy settings**  
  If you manually select policy settings for an environment, these _inline_ selections override any global Promotion Policy settings that match the product/environment when the flow is triggered.

* **Global Promotion Policy settings**
  If no inline settings are selected, the system applies global Promotion Policy settings based on predefined priorities. <!-- See TBD -->

alt="Inline vs. global Promotion Policy settings" 
caption="Inline vs. global Promotion Policy settings"
max-width="60%"
%}

##### Promotion Workflows
Both Pre- and Post-Action Workflows are optional in a Promotion Flow, unless defined in the Policy. 

##### Previewing Promotion Policies by Product
Instead of waiting for a Promotion Flow to be triggered to see policy settings applied to environments, you can preview which global Promotion Policy settings are applied to a product within the flow.
Policy evaluation by product is useful to verify if the environment and product have the desired policies, or to identify environments with missing policies, or required settings such as the Promotion Action.

1. To commit changes, click **Save Promotion Flow**.
  The Promotion Flow is added to the list of Promotion Flows.




## Evaluate global Promotion Policy settings by product
Select a product to evaluate the settings that will be applied from global Promotion Policies for all target environments without inline settings. 
Global Promotion Policy settings are applied from all Policies that match the product and the environment, according to priority.

{{site.data.callout.callout_tip}}
**TIP**    
  When evaluating policies by product, only policy settings without inline values are populated in the preview.  
  Previewing policy settings does not affect the actual Promotion Flow when triggered.
{{site.data.callout.end}}


1. From the list of Products, select the product for which to evaluate or apply Promotion Policy settings.
  The Promotion Action, Pre- and Post-Action Workflows that match are applied from the global Promotion Policies and displayed for each environment. Mouse over the Pre-Action, Post-Action, and Action icons to see the Workflows and the Promotion Action assigned.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

alt="Evaluating global Promotion Policy settings by product" 
caption="Evaluating global Promotion Policy settings by product"
max-width="60%"
%}

{:start="2"}  
1. If you get an error that the component is not defined for the Policy, click the corresponding icon and assign a Workflow or an Action.






## Remove environments from Promotion Flows
Remove one or more environments from a Promotion Flow. <!--- TBD why would you want to remove an environment? What happens if the env is defined as part of the promotion policies?  -->Removing an environment requires you to reconnect environments linked to the one being removed to prevent orhpaned environments. 

Reconnecting environments is only relevant when there are one or more environments in the flow _following_ the one being removed. If the environment you’re removing, for example `staging` is the final environment in the flow, you can remove it directly without needing to reconnect.

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, and then from the sidebar, select **Promotion Flows**. 
1. Select the Promotion Flow with the environment you want to remove.
1. Mouse over the environment node and then click {::nomarkdown}<img src="../../../../images/icons/delete-red.png" display=inline-block>{:/}.
  If the environment is linked to another one (not the last environment in the flow), you are prompted to select the reconnect behavior.  

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/gitops-promotions/promotion-flow/remove-environments.png" 
url="/images/gitops-promotions/promotion-flow/remove-environments.png"
alt="Remove environment from a Promotion Flow" 
caption="Remove environment from a Promotion Flow"
max-width="60%"
%}

{:start="4"}
1. Do one of the following:
    * If you have environments in the flow linked to the environment you are removing, from the **Reconnect next environments to** list, select a preceding environment to reconnect to.  
      For example, consider a promotion flow with `dev`, `qa`, `staging`, and `prod` environments in that order. When removing the `staging` environment which is linked to `production`, you need to reconnect to one of the preceding environments, `qa` selected in the example above.
    * To remove all connected environments, select **Remove all connected environments**.
      This action removes all environments linked to and succeeding `qa`, which are `staging` and `production` in the example below. 
    
{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"
