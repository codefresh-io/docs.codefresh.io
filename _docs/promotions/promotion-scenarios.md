A successful promotion sequence relies on several key components that together govern and orchestrate the promotion flow across environments. The sections that follow takes you through configuring several scenarios for promotions, from basic to complex promotions.


Hereâ€™s how to progress from basic to advanced promotion sequences:

##### Applications, Products, and Environments
These core deployment entities are required for all promotions. Products enable you to group and configure related applications, and environments define where changes to these applications are promoted.
With these entities, you can quickly promote changes using a drag-and-drop method between two environments and choose the target environment for promotion.

##### Promotion Flows
After setting up the basics, orchestrate promotion across multiple environments. 
Use our Promotion Flow entity to create complex, multi-environment deployment strategies.

##### Promotion Workflows
Adding Promotion Workflows introduces validations and checks that ensure each environment in the sequence meets your standards.
