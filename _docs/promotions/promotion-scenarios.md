We have moved Promotion Tutorials to the GitOps Quick Start section.

This ensures a seamless learning journey, starting from setting up your Codefresh account and installing a Runtime, to creating environments, products, applications, and finally promoting applications across environments. 

Go to [GitOps quick start]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/gitops-quick-start/gitops-quick-start/).
