A successful promotion sequence relies on several key components that together govern and orchestrate the promotion flow across environments. We haves that follow takes you through configuring several scenarios for promotions, from basic to complex promotions.

We have moved Promotion Tutorials to the GitOps Quick Start section. This ensures a seamless learning journey, starting from setting up your Codefresh account and installing a Runtime to creating environments, products, applications, and finally promoting applications across environments. The tutorials now align with the structured progression of the quick start series, helping you build deployment step-by-step.
