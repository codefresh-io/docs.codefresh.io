Codefresh provides two options for defining manifests for promotion entities: Form mode and YAML mode.

If you prefer working with YAML, create manifests for promotion entities using our YAML examples:  
* [Product YAML]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/yaml/product-crd/)
* [Promotion Template YAML]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/yaml/promotion-template-crd/)
* [Promotion Flow YAML]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/yaml/promotion-flow-crd/)
* [Promotion Policy YAML]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/promotions/configuration/yaml/promotion-policy-crd/)
