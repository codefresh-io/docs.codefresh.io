Codefresh provides two options for defining manifests for promotion entities: Form mode and YAML mode.

If you prefer working with YAML, create the manifest using the example Promotion Policy YAML below, and the table with field descriptions.

Once configured and committed, the settings are saved as a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) within the Shared Configuration Repository in the GitOps Runtime specified as the Configuration Runtime.

## Promotion Policy YAML example
Here's an example of the Promotion Policy manifest. The table that follows describes the fields in the Promotion Policy manifest. 


```yaml
apiVersion: codefresh.io/v1beta1
kind: PromotionPolicy
metadata:
  name: demo-policy
spec:
  priority: 2
  selector:
    product:
      names:
      - trio-dev
    targetEnvironment:
      names:
      - staging
      types:
      - NON_PROD
  policy:
    action: commit
    preAction: smoke-tests
    postAction: slack-notification
```
