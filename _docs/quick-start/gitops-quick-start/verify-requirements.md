Hybrid GitOps Runtimes are installed via Helm charts. 


## New installation 
If this is your first time installing GitOps in Codefresh, review and confirm that your deployment environment conforms to the minimum requirements for Hybrid GitOps installation. Check the [system requirements]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops-helm-installation/#minimum-system-requirements).  


## Existing CLI-based Hybrid GitOps installation  
If you already have a CLI-based Hybrid GitOps Runtime installed on your cluster, you _must migrate your CLI-based Runtime to the Helm-based Runtime_.
Read and follow the guidelines in [Migrating GitOps Runtimes from CLI to Helm]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/migrate-cli-runtimes-helm/).
