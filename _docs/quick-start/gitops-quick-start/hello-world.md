Now that you have successfully installed the hybrid runtime, you can trigger one of the Hello World demo pipelines included in the runtime package.
The two Hello World example pipelines are triggered by different event conditions:
* Git (GitHub) event 
* Calendar (cron) event

For the quick start, let's focus on the `github/hello-world` pipeline.

### Create a PAT token
To commit resources for the `github/hello-world` pipeline, you need to add a PAT to Codefresh.

1. Create your personal token with a valid `expiration` date and `scope` with `base64` encoding.  
  For the pipeline, you need `repo` and `admin-repo.hook` scopes:  
  
  {% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/getting-started/quick-start/quick-start-git-event-permissions.png" 
   url="/images/getting-started/quick-start/quick-start-git-event-permissions.png" 
   alt="GitHub PAT permissions for Hello World pipeline" 
   caption="GitHub PAT permissions for Hello World pipeline"
   max-width="30%" 
   %}  

{:start="2"}
1. In the Codefresh UI, go to [User Settings](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/user-settings){:target="\_blank"}, add your token.

### View pipelines
View the pipelines in Codefresh. 

1. In the Codefresh UI, go to [Delivery Pipelines](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/pipelines){:target="\_blank"}. 

  {% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/getting-started/quick-start/quick-start-pipelines.png" 
   url="/images/getting-started/quick-start/quick-start-pipelines.png" 
   alt="Demo pipelines in the Pipelines page" 
   caption="Demo pipelines in the Pipelines page"
   max-width="30%" 
   %}  

   * The `github/hello-world` pipeline has not been triggered as it requires a Git event to trigger it. 
   * The `cron/hello-world` pipeline shows statistics as it has already been triggered based on the `cron` interval.  

### View and update manifest
As we don't have a workflow for this pipeline, you will configure the Git Source resource in the pipeline's **Manifest** tab.
1. In the **Pipelines** page, to drill down, select the pipeline name.
1. Select the **Manifest** tab, and click the arrowhead to expand the resource view.
  
   {% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/getting-started/quick-start/quick-start-manifest-expand.png" 
   url="/images/getting-started/quick-start/quick-start-manifest-expand.png" 
   alt="Expand resource view in Mainfests tab" 
   caption="Expand resource view in Mainfests tab"
   max-width="30%" 
   %} 
  
  You can see these resources:    

  * Event Source (`event-source.git-source.yaml`).
  * Sensor (`sensor.git-source.yaml`)
  * Workflow Template (`workflow-template.hellow-world.yaml`)  


  > The pipeline is configured to run on a `PUSH` event in the Git repository.


Codefresh does the following:
* Commits the changes to your Git repository.
* Synchronizes the changes in Git back to your cluster, and updates the `event-source.git-source` resource.
* Triggers this pipeline after the `PUSH` event to your repository.
* Creates a workflow. View it in the UI, in the [Workflows](https://g.codefresh.io/2.0/workflows){:target="\_blank"} dashboard.  
  Select view workflow details to see the workflow log.
