The [Kubernetes deployment quick start]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/ci-quick-start/deploy-to-kubernetes/) showed you how to quickly deploy an application directly to Kubernetes.  

The Helm quick start guides you through using [Helm](https://helm.sh/){:target="\_blank"} as a package manager in Codefresh to deploy to Kubernetes, view the Helm release, and store a Helm chart.   

[Helm](https://helm.sh/){:target="\_blank"} is similar to other package managers (yum, apt, npm, maven, pip, gems), but works at the application level allowing you to deploy multiple manifests together.  



<!--- Helm offers several extra features on top of vanilla Kubernetes deployments, some of which are: 

* The ability to group multiple Kubernetes manifests together and treat them as a single entity (for deployments, rollbacks, and storage). Groups of Manifests are called [Helm Charts](https://helm.sh/docs/topics/charts/).
* Built-in templating for Kubernetes manifests, putting an end to custom template systems that you might use for replacing things such as the Docker tag inside a manifest.
* The ability to create Charts of Charts which contain the templates as well as default values. This means
that you can describe the dependencies of an application in the service level and deploy everything at the same time.
* The ability to create catalogs of applications (Helm repositories) that function similar to traditional package repositories (think npm registry, cpan, maven central, ruby gems etc).  -->


<!---   and has native support for Helm in a number of ways:

1. Easily deploy existing Helm packages to your Kubernetes cluster overriding the default values.
1. Easily create new Helm packages and push them to a Helm repository.
1. View Helm releases and even [perform rollbacks]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/helm-releases-management/) from the Helm Dashboard.
1. You can [browse Helm packages]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/add-helm-repository/)  both from public repositories and your internal Helm repository.
1. You can see Helm releases in the [Environment dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deploy-to-kubernetes/environment-dashboard/)
1. You can promote Helm releases with the [Promotion dashboard]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/helm-environment-promotion/)  -->


This quick start will show you how to:

1. Deploy a Helm release to your Kubernetes cluster
1. View the Helm release
1. Store a Helm package inside the integrated Codefresh repository



For reasons of simplicity, we will use the [default Docker registry]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/external-docker-registries/#the-default-registry) that is set up globally in your Codefresh account. For your own application you can also use any other of your registries even if it is not the default.


## Prerequisites
* A [Kubernetes cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/kubernetes/add-kubernetes-cluster/) in Codefresh
* The Docker registry you connected to your Codefresh account in the CI pipeline quick start 
* An application that has a Dockerfile and a [Helm chart]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/using-helm-in-codefresh-pipeline/#helm-setup) 
* Cluster with pull access to your default Docker registry
  If you are not familiar, read [Manually deploy Docker image to Kubernetes]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/quick-start/ci-quick-start/deploy-to-kubernetes/#manually-deploy-docker-image-to-kubernetes), or read about [secrets]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/kubernetes/deploy-to-kubernetes/create-image-pull-secret/) <!--- ask Kostis -->

If you want to follow along, feel free to fork this [repository](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/python-flask-sample-app){:target="\_blank"} in your Git account and look at the [with-helm](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/python-flask-sample-app/tree/with-helm){:target="\_blank"} branch.

## Deploy a Helm Release to your Kubernetes cluster


<!--- 1. In the Codefresh UI, expand Ops from the sidebar, and select **Helm Releases**. 
   As you don't have any Helm releases, you see an empty screen.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

alt="Empty Helm cluster" 
caption="Empty Helm cluster" 
max-width="70%" 
%}  -->



Codefresh provides a special [Helm step](https://codefresh.io/steps/step/helm){:target="\_blank"} that you can use to perform a deployment.
We will create a new pipeline with the Helm deploy step and run it to deploy the release to your Kubernetes cluster.


The `DeployMyChart` Helm step has three environment variables:
* `chart_name` points to the [chart in the Git repository](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/python-flask-sample-app/tree/with-helm/charts/python){:target="\_blank"}. 
* `release_name` defines the name of the deployment to be created in the cluster. 
* `kube_context` defines which cluster to be used. The name is the same as that of the cluster you added [Codefresh Integrations](https://g.codefresh.io/account-admin/account-conf/integration/kubernetes).

The step deploys the Helm chart using the default values as found in `values.yaml` within the chart folder.  
It makes sense to override the defaults using some parameters in the build. For example, instead of tagging the Docker image with the branch name (which is always the same for each build), we could tag it with the hash of the source revision.  

The `custom_values` override the default chart values. The underscores are replaced with dots.
Here we override the name of tag (to match the Docker image built in the previous step) and the pull policy.



1. From the Project page, select the project you created. 
1. Click **Create Pipeline**.
1. Define the following:  
  * **Project**: The project is already selected.
  * **Pipeline Name**: Enter a name for the pipeline that will deploy with Helm.
  * **Add Git repository**: Toggle to on. This setting launches the pipeline when there is a commit to the Git repository.
  * **Add Git clone step to pipeline**: Select the repository with the sample application you forked from the list.
1. Click **Create**.
    In the Workflow tab, you'll see that the Inline YAML editor already has a sample YAML.
1. Replace the existing content in the Inline YAML editor with the example below.
`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - checkout
  - package
  - deploy  
steps:
  clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    arguments:
      repo: '${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}'
      revision: '${{CF_REVISION}}'
    stage: checkout
  BuildingDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image

    arguments:
      image_name: my-flask-app
      working_directory: ./python-flask-sample-app

      kube_context: kostis-demo@FirstKubernetes
      custom_values:
      - 'buildID=${{CF_BUILD_ID}}'
      - 'image_pullPolicy=Always'
      - 'repository=r.cfcr.io/kostis-codefresh/my-flask-app'
      - 'image_tag=${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}-${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
      - 'image_pullSecret=codefresh-generated-r.cfcr.io-cfcr-default'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}
{:start="5"}
1. Click **Save** and then click **Run** twice to run the pipeline. 
1. Continue with [View Helm release](#view-helm-release).

You can see the value replacements in the Helm logs inside the pipeline:

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-logs.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-logs.png" 
alt="Helm Value replacement" 
caption="Helm Value replacement" 
max-width="100%" 
%}


This is the easiest way to deploy to Kubernetes without having to manually change values in manifests. Helm and Codefresh handle the replacements using the built-in steps.

## View Helm release 

When a Helm package is deployed to your Kubernetes cluster, Codefresh displays it in the [Helm releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/helm-releases-management/) dashboard.

### Before you begin
* [Deploy a Helm Release to your Kubernetes cluster](#deploy-a-helm-release-to-your-kubernetes-cluster)

### How to

1. In the Codefresh UI, expand Ops from the sidebar, and select **Helm Releases**.
   The new release is displayed.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-release-details.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-release-details.png" 
alt="Helm Releases dashboard with new release" 
caption="Helm Releases dashboard with new release" 
max-width="90%" 
%}

<!--1. If you don't see your release, click the **Settings** icon at the top-right of the cluster, and make sure the correct namespace is selected for your application.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-version-selection.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-version-selection.png" 
alt="Choosing a Helm version" 
caption="Choosing a Helm version (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="50%" 
%} -->

{:start="2"}
1. Click on the release and get information regarding its chart, its revisions, changed files and the resulting manifests.

The build values that we defined in the `codefresh.yml` are shown here in a separate tab so it is very easy to 
verify the correct parameters.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-values.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-values.png" 
alt="Helm values" 
caption="Helm values" 
max-width="70%" 
%}

>Tip:  
  To view the services/pods/deployments that comprise the helm release, go to the [Kubernetes Services dashboard](https://g.codefresh.io/kubernetes/services/){:target="\_blank"}.


## Roll back a Helm release

<!--- is this relevant in terms of the quick start? they only have one release right -->

With Helm, you can rollback a Helm release to a previous version without actually re-running the pipeline.  
Helm gives you easy rollbacks for free. If you make some commits in your project, Helm retains the same deployment and adds new revisions on it. The server part of Helm keeps a history of all releases, and knows the exact contents of each respective Helm package.  
As the rollback creates a new revision, you can  move backwards and forwards in time to any revision.

1. In the Codefresh UI, expand Ops from the sidebar, and select **Helm Releases**.
1. Click on the release, and then select the **History** tab.
1. From the list of revisions, select one as the rollback target.


 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-rollback.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-rollback.png" 
alt="Helm rollback" 
caption="Helm rollback" 
max-width="70%" 
%}



## Store a Helm chart 

Codefresh includes a [built-in Helm repository]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/helm/managed-helm-repository/), available to all accounts. Like any other public Helm repository, you can store charts in this repository, and also manually deploy applications from it.

For the quick start, we will modify the pipeline with the Helm deploy step you created in the previous task. 
We use the same `helm` step, but instead of deploying the Helm package which is the default action, we define `push` as the action. The pipeline now stores the Helm chart in the internal repository.

To store a Helm chart, you either need to import the shared configuration that defines the integrated Helm repository, or define the repository URL directly.  
For the quick start, we will import the shared configuration. 


### Before you begin
* [Create and run pipeline with a Helm step](#create-and-run-pipeline-with-a-helm-step)

### How to

1. In the Codefresh UI, expand Pipelines in the sidebar, and select **Pipelines**.
1. Select the pipeline with the Helm deploy step.
1. In the Workflow tab, click the  **Variables** tab on the right.
1. From the Variables toolbar, click the context menu, and then select **Add Shared Configuration**.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-select-shared-configuration.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-helm/helm-select-shared-configuration.png" 
alt="Add Shared Configuration option" 
caption="Add Shared Configuration option" 
max-width="70%" 
%}
     
{:start="5"}
1. From the list, select **CF_HELM_DEFAULT** which defines the configuration of the integrated Helm repository, and click **Add**.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/import-helm-repo-conf.png"

alt="Helm settings" 
caption="Import Helm repository configuration" 
max-width="70%" 
%}

{:start="6"}
1. Go to the Inline YAML editor with the pipeline definition and modify the deploy step in your `codefresh.yml`:  
`YAML`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - checkout
  - package
  - deploy  
steps:
  clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    arguments:
      repo: '${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}'
      revision: '${{CF_REVISION}}'
    stage: checkout
  BuildingDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    working_directory: ${{clone}}
    arguments:
      image_name: my-flask-app
      tag: '${{CF_BRANCH_TAG_NORMALIZED}}-${{CF_SHORT_REVISION}}'
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    stage: package
  deploy:
    title: Storing Helm chart
    type: helm
    stage: deploy
    working_directory: ./python-flask-sample-app
    arguments:
      action: push
      chart_name: charts/python
      helm_version: 3.0.2
      kube_context: 'mydemoAkscluster@BizSpark Plus'
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

  As you can see, the `action` argument has `push` as its value.

{:start="7"}
1. Click **Save** and then click **Run** twice to run the pipeline.
1. View the pipeline build in the [Helm releases]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-helm/helm-releases-management/) dashboard.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-only-store.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-only-store.png" 
alt="Storing Helm chart" 
caption="Storing Helm chart" 
max-width="100%" 
%}

{:start="8"}click the 
1. When the pipeline build completes execution, expand Artifacts from the sidebar, and select **Helm charts**.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-repo.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-helm/helm-repo.png" 
alt="Helm chart in repository" 
caption="Helm chart in repository" 
max-width="70%" 
%}


> You can click the **Install** button to manually deploy manually the chart. Codefresh will allow to enter your own values in that case and also select your target cluster.

<!--- You can also create a single pipeline that [both stores the chart as well as deploys it in a cluster]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/yaml-examples/examples/helm/). You can learn more about [Helm best practices and Helm pipelines]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docs/new-helm/helm-best-practices/#helm-concepts) to determine which solution is best.  -->

You now know how to deploy a Helm release from Codefresh, view the release, and store the Helm chart in a repository.
