This quick start guides you through setting up a CI (continuous integration) pipeline in Codefresh to create the Docker image of a sample application, run the pipeline, view results, and optionally upload the Docker image to a public registry.

This quick start describes the following tasks:

1. [Create and run pipeline](#create-and-run-ci-pipeline)  
1. [Run unit tests on the Docker image](#run-unit-tests-on-the-docker-image)
1. [(Optional) Upload Docker images to Docker Hub](#optional-upload-docker-images-to-docker-hub)

1. Connects to GitHub and checks out the source code of the sample application
1. Uses the Dockerfile of the application to create a Docker image
1. Runs unit tests in the same Docker image to verify the validity of the code
1. Stores the Docker image in your private Registry
1. (Optional) Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub

### Note on the sample application
For the pipeline, we'll use a sample application, the [Python/Flask](https://www.palletsprojects.com/p/flask/){:target="\_blank"} project, that has:
* Its own [Dockerfile](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/python-flask-sample-app/blob/master/Dockerfile){:target="\_blank"} in the root of the repository.
* Unit tests.

You can either use the sample application to follow along, or create your own Docker based example (don't forget to write unit tests).


>**NOTE**  
With Codefresh you can create a Docker image from without any local Docker installation (Docker building as a service).





## Pipeline quick start prerequisites

* Codefresh account
* Free [GitHub account](https://github.com/join){:target="\_blank"}
* Docker registry service account, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/features/packages){:target="\_blank"}
* Source code of the sample application
* (Optional) Docker Hub account if you also want to make your image public

### Download source code of the sample application
We use an example application located in GitHub. 

>**NOTE**  
Codefresh supports GitLab, Bitbucket and Azure GIT repositories apart from GitHub. The
same principles presented in this tutorial apply for all Git providers.


1. Go to the GitHub repo with the [Python Flask](https://github.com/codefresh-contrib/python-flask-sample-app) sample application. 
1. At the top-right, click **Fork** to bring the source code to your own account.

 {% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/fork-example-project.png" 
alt="Forking the example application" 
caption="Forking the example application" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

After a few minutes, you should see the repo in your Git account.

## Create and run pipeline

We'll start by focusing on the first part of the CI pipeline, creating a Docker image.  

Docker images play a central role in Codefresh pipelines. They are the basic building blocks that serve as the link
between what your source code generates and what gets deployed.  

The example application already comes with its own Dockerfile. If your own application is not "dockerized" yet, first create a Dockerfile for it, and then move it into the Codefresh infrastructure. 

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/docker-build-steps.jpg" 
alt="Preparing a Docker image" 
caption="Preparing a Docker image" 
max-width="60%" 
%}



<!--Because all Codefresh capabilities are based on Docker images, Docker is also serving as an abstraction layer over any the implementation language of your source code. Codefresh can work with projects written in Ruby, Python, Java, Node or any other programming language as long as they produce a Docker image. Docker images are a first class citizen in Codefresh pipelines and not just an afterthought.-->

Creating a Docker image through a Codefresh pipeline includes these tasks:
1. [Connect a Docker registry to Codefresh](#connect-a-docker-registry-to-codefresh)
1. [Create a project for CI pipeline](#create-a-project-for-ci-pipeline)
1. [Create and run CI pipeline](#create-and-run-ci-pipeline)
1. [View and monitor CI pipeline build](#view-and-monitor-ci-pipeline-build)
1. [View the Docker image stored in Codefresh](#view-the-docker-image-stored-in-codefresh)

### Connect a Docker registry to Codefresh

Connect your Docker regsitry to Codefresh to store the Docker image of the sample application.
Codefresh supports all the popular Docker registries. 
If you don't already have a registry, we recommend starting with the GitHub Registry for this quick start. 

#### Before you begin
Make sure you have completed all the [prerequsites](#quick-start-prerequisites) for the CI pipeline quick start 

#### How to

1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, and then from Configuration, select **Pipeline Integrations**.
1. Select **Docker Registries** and then click **Configure**.
1. From the **Add Registry Provider** dropdown, select **Other Registries**.
1. Define the following:  
  * **Registry name**: A unique name for this configuration.
  * **Username**: Your GitHub username.
  * **Password**: Your GitHub personal token.
  * **Domain**: `ghcr.io`.
  * Expand **Advanced Options** and define the [**Repository Prefix**]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/#using-an-optional-repository-prefix) as your GitHub username.

{:start="5"}
1. To verify the connection details, click **Test Connection**.
1. To apply the changes, click **Save**.
1. Continue with [Create a project for CI pipeline](#create-a-project-for-ci-pipeline)

### Create a project for pipeline

Codefresh pipelines are grouped within projects. Think of a project as a folder or directory that groups related pipelines. For example, all pipleines that package/deploy the different microservices for an application.
You can define any name for the  project, the most common example being the name of the application that the pipelines build and deploy.

#### Before you begin

* [Connect a Docker registry to Codefresh](#connect-a-docker-registry-to-codefresh)

#### How to
1. In the Codefresh UI, expand Pipelines in the sidebar, and select **Projects**.
1. On the top-right, click **New Project**.
1. Enter the **Project Name**. For example, `my-first-project`.
1. Leave the **Project Tags** empty for the quick start.
1. Select any **Icon** you want. The icon is prefixed to the project name in the Projects page.
1. Click **Create**.  

{% include image.html 
	lightbox="true" 
	file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/create-ci-project.png" 
	url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/create-ci-project.png" 
	alt="Create project for CI pipeline"
	caption="Create project for CI pipeline" 
	max-width="70%" 
%}

  You now have a new project and can create your CI first pipeline within the project.

{:start="6"}
1. Continue with [Create and run CI pipeline](#create-and-run-ci-pipeline).

### Create and run CI pipeline
Create a CI pipeline to clone the Git repo and build the Docker image.   
The pipeline includes two steps:
  * A [git-clone]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/) step to check out the code.
    The clone step also uses built-in variables that ensures that the pipeline checks out the exact code described in the commit of the trigger. Don't worry if the exact details are not clear to you yet. 
  * A [build]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/) step to build the docker image **AND** push it to the connected Docker registry.
    The build step uses a Dockerfile that is located at the root folder of the project and creates a Docker image with tag `v1.0.0`.

#### Before you begin
* [Create a project for CI pipeline](#create-a-project-for-ci-pipeline)

#### How to
1. From the Project page, select the project you created. 
1. Click **Create Pipeline**.
1. Define the following:  
  * **Project**: The project is already selected.
  * **Pipeline Name**: Enter a name for the pipeline.
  * **Add Git repository**: Toggle to on. This setting launches the pipeline when there is a commit to the Git repository.
  * **Add Git clone step to pipeline**: Select the repository with the sample application you forked from the list.
1. Click **Create**.  
  In the Workflow tab of the pipeline creation workspace, you'll see that the Inline YAML editor already has a sample YAML.

{:start="6"}
1. To apply your changes, click **Save**. 
1. To start the pipeline, click **Run**.
1. Retain the default settings, and click **Run** once again.
1. Continue with [View and monitor CI pipeline build](#view-and-monitor-ci-pipeline-build).

### View and monitor CI pipeline build 
When you run the pipeline, Codefresh takes you to the Builds page where you can monitor the build progress of the sample application.

#### Before you begin
* [Create and run CI pipeline](#create-and-run-ci-pipeline)

#### How to
1. Click on the step **Building Docker Image**, and view the logs in the **Output** tab. 
  You can download the logs in HTML or text formats if you want to review them offline. 

The build should complete successfully.

All <!-- is this correct? should it be - future? -->previous runs are displayed in the [Builds page](https://g.codefresh.io/builds).

caption="Build details" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

1. Continue with [View Docker image stored in Codefresh](#view-docker-image-stored-in-codefresh).

### View Docker image stored in Codefresh

The build logs show that a Docker image is created after each successful build. Where does this image go?

Codefresh has the unique feature where the build step that creates the Docker image, also automatically pushes the image to your default Docker registry! All the images that we have created so far, are stored in the registry you connected at the beginning of the quick start.

max-width="80%" 
%}

#### Before you begin
[View and monitor CI pipeline build](#view-and-monitor-ci-pipeline-build)

#### How to
1. In the Codefresh UI, expand **Artifacts** in the sidebar, and click **Images**.  
  A list of Docker images are displayed, sorted by the most recently added images. This dashboard is populated in real-time with updates from your Docker registry.

<!--
NEED TO BE REVISED ACC TO NEW IMAGES 
Among the information shown, you can clearly see:

* What is the Git Branch that created this image
* What is the Git Hash that contained the last commit

This information can help you to easily correlate the changes that exist in each Docker images, which is very important knowledge when it comes to deployments (explained in detail in the next tutorial).

If you click on a Docker image you will get many more details about it including a timeline of the labels for this Docker image. You also have the ability to enter custom comments that describe any event that you consider important. Codefresh
really shines when it comes to annotating your Docker images with metadata. For more details read the section [Annotations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/docker-registries/metadata-annotations/).

url="/images/getting-started/quick-start-ci/docker-timeline.png" 
alt="Docker Image timeline" 
caption="Docker Image timeline (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="50%" 
%}

Codefresh also includes a graphical display of all the layers contained in the Docker image. This can help you identify big layers in your build process and hopefully give you some pointers on how to reduce the size of your deployment binaries.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true"

alt="Docker Layer Analysis" 
caption="Docker Layer Analysis (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="70%" 
%}

The built-in Docker image storage is very helpful on its own, but it becomes even more impressive when it is coupled with the capability to use it as a basis for temporary demo environments, as we will see in the next section. -->

## Run unit tests on the Docker image
Run unit tests to validate the Docker image and confirm that it satisfies the requested functionality. Unit tests must be an integral part of the build process.

We will add a new [freestyle step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/freestyle/) to the pipeline's YAML, that runs unit tests. Freestyle steps run custom commands within Docker containers.

For the quick start, we run the python command [within the docker image]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/variables/#context-related-variables), created from the previous step `MyAppDockerImage` defined by the `image` property.


{% include 
image.html

alt="Unit tests workflow" 
caption="Unit tests workflow" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

### Before you begin

* Verify you have a Docker image in Codefresh 

### How to

1. In the Builds page, click the **YAML** tab and then click **Edit Pipeline**.  
  The Inline YAML editor in the Workflow tab is displayed. 
1. Paste the following YAML that includes the new step to run unit tests into the Inline editor:

<!--- Do we need this?>The sample application already has unit tests that can be executed with:
``` 
pip install pytest && pytest
``` -->
`codefresh.yml`
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - checkout
  - package
  - test  
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    repo: '${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}'
    revision: '${{CF_REVISION}}'
    stage: checkout
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    stage: package
    image_name: my-app-image #Change to your image name
    working_directory: ./
    tag: v1.0.1
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running Unit tests
    image: '${{MyAppDockerImage}}'
    stage: test 
    commands: 
      - pip install pytest
      - pytest   
{% endraw %}      
{% endhighlight %}
{:start="3"}
1. Click **Run** and then click **Run** again to relaunch the build.
1. In the Builds page, you can see a new stage with the step labeled **Running unit tests**.
1. Click the step name to see the test output of the application.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/unit-test-result.png" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/unit-test-result.png" 
alt="Unit test results" 
caption="Unit test results" 
max-width="60%" 
%}
{:start="6"}
1. Continue with [(Optional) Upload Docker images to Docker Hub](#optional-upload-docker-images-to-docker-hub).

> Tip:  
  Codefresh can also run [integration tests]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/composition/), and report [test results]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/testing/test-reports/).  
  Therefore, regardless of the type of tests you employ, Codefresh can accommodate your testing process in a fully automated manner as part of the main build.


## (Optional) Upload Docker images to Docker Hub

As we saw in the previous task, Codefresh automatically pushes the Docker image to the default Docker registry. 
You can also upload the same Docker image to a different external registry or make it public in Docker Hub.

The [push pipeline step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/build/) does exactly that. It pushes an existing Docker image to the registry you define.


{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/docker-push-stage.jpg" 
url="/images/quick-start/quick-start-ci/docker-push-stage.jpg" 
alt="Pushing a Docker image" 
caption="Pushing a Docker image" 
max-width="80%" 
%}

As the last task in the CI pipeline quick start, we will push our sample application to [Docker Hub](https://cloud.docker.com/){:target="\_blank"}, the free public hosting registry of Docker Inc.
To do so, you will first need to create a free account in Docker Hub and then connect Docker Hub to Codefresh. 


### Before you begin
* Verify you have a Docker image in Codefresh 


### How to
1. Create a free account in Docker Hub. 
1. Note down your username and password. 
  In your own projects, you can use any other [external registry]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/docker-registries/).

  >Docker.io allows you to only push images tagged with your username.  
    If you can do so, create a Docker Hub account with the same username that you have in Codefresh.  
    If not, you need to change the Docker image created to match your username in your Docker Hub account.

{:start="3"}
1. In the Codefresh UI, on the toolbar, click the **Settings** icon, and then from Configuration, select **Pipeline Integrations**.
1. Select **Docker Registries** and then click **Configure**.
1. From the **Add Registry Provider** dropdown, select **Docker Hub**.
1. Define the following:  
  * **Registry name**: Enter a unique name for this configuration. Note down the regsitry name. You will need it to define it in the pipeline.
  * **Username**: Your Docker Hub username.
  * **Password**: Your Docker Hub password.
  * To verify the connection details, click **Test Connection**. You should see a success message.
1. To apply the changes, click **Save**.
   You have now connected your Docker Hub account to your Codefresh account. 


{% include 
image.html

max-width="60%" 
%}

{:start="8"}
1. Go back to the [Builds](https://g.codefresh.io/builds2){:target="\_blank"} page, and click the pipeline to return to the Inline editor. 
1. Paste the following YAML to replace the existing content.
  We added a [push step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/push/) at the end of the pipeline. The image is tagged with the name of the branch.
{% highlight yaml %}
{% raw %}
version: '1.0'
stages:
  - checkout
  - package
  - test 
  - upload    
steps:
  main_clone:
    title: Cloning main repository...
    type: git-clone
    repo: '${{CF_REPO_OWNER}}/${{CF_REPO_NAME}}'
    revision: '${{CF_REVISION}}'
    stage: checkout
  MyAppDockerImage:
    title: Building Docker Image
    type: build
    stage: package
    image_name: my-app-image
    working_directory: ./
    tag: v1.0.1
    dockerfile: Dockerfile
  MyUnitTests:
    title: Running Unit tests
    image: '${{MyAppDockerImage}}'
    stage: test 
    commands: 
      - pip install pytest
      - pytest      
  MyPushStep:
    title: Pushing to Docker Registry
    type: push
    stage: upload
    tag: '${{CF_BRANCH}}'
    candidate: '${{MyAppDockerImage}}'
    image_name: kkapelon/pythonflasksampleapp #Change kkapelon to your dockerhub username
    registry: dockerhub # Name of your integration as was defined in the Registry screen
{% endraw %}      
{% endhighlight %}
{:start="10"}
1. Replace the `registry` name in the push step with the name you specified in the Docker Hub integration settings.
1. To apply your changes, click **Save**, and then click **Run** to start the pipeline again.
1. Click the **Pushing to Docker registry** step to view the log and monitor the progress of the push step.

max-width="70%" 
%}


>**NOTE**    
Now you have two Docker registries connected to Codefresh. After the build completes execution, the Docker image of the sample application is stored **both** in the default Docker registry and in Docker Hub.


To verify the latter, visit your profile in Docker Hub and look at the image details:

{% include
