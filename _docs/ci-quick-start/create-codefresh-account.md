Once you have installed Codefresh, the next step is to create an account in Codefresh.

After you select the IdP (identity provider), Codefresh requests permission to access your basic details, and for Git providers, to access your Git repositories. 
The permissions requested by Codefresh are needed in order to build and deploy your projects.

## Supported IdPs
Codefresh currently supports the following IdPs:
* GitHub
* Bitbucket
* GitLab 
* Azure
* Google 
* LDAP

If you need an IdP that is not in the list, please [contact us](https://codefresh.io/contact-us/){:target="\_blank"} with the details.


>**NOTE**     
For Git repositories, the login method is less important, as you can access Git repositories through [Git integrations]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/integrations/git-providers/), regardless of your sign-up process. <br><br>
If you have multiple sign-up methods, as long as you use the same email address in all the sign-ups, Codefresh automatically redirects you to the account dashboard.

## Create Codefresh account
1. Go to the [Codefresh Sign Up page](https://g.codefresh.io/signup).  <!---need to change the URL and the screenshot-->

  * For GitHub: To continue, click **Authorize codefresh-io**.
