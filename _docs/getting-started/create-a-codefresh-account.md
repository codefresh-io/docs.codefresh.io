Before you can start building and deploying your applications
you need to create a Codefresh account.

Creating an account is free (no credit card is required) and can be done in 3 simple steps.

## 1. Select your Source Control (Git) provider

First, navigate to the [Codefresh Sign Up page](https://g.codefresh.io/signup).  
Codefresh currently supports Github, Bitbucket and Gitlab as a Git provider. If you are using another Git provider
please [contact us](https://codefresh.io/contact-us/) to discuss alternative options.

{% include

lightbox="true"

url="/images/getting-started/create-account/select-git-provider.png"
alt="Codefresh sign-up page"

max-width="40%" 
%}

Click on the provider that contains your Git repositories.


>If you wish to add repositories that exist in other GIT providers, you can add them after creating
your account via the [GIT integrations]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/integrations/git-providers/).


## 2. Accept the Permissions Request

After you select the Git provider that has your repositories, Codefresh requests permission to access your Git account details.

Don't worry, Codefresh will not do anything without your explicit approval, so don't be scared by the permissions shown
in the request window. The permissions requested by Codefresh are needed in order to build and deploy your projects.


This is the Github permissions window. Click the button labeled *Authorize access* to continue.

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/create-account/github-authorize.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/create-account/github-authorize.png"
alt="Github authorization page" 
caption="Github authorization page (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="50%" 
%}

If you use Bitbucket the following permissions window will appear instead. Click the button labeled *grant access* to continue.


{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/create-account/bitbucket-authorize.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/create-account/bitbucket-authorize.png"
alt="Bitbucket authorization page" 
caption="Bitbucket authorization page (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="50%" 
%}

Finally if you use Gitlab you will see  the permissions window shown below. Click the button labeled *Authorize* to continue.


{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/create-account/gitlab-authorize.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/create-account/gitlab-authorize.png"
alt="Gitlab authorization page" 
caption="Gitlab authorization page (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="50%" 
%}

Once you accept the respective permissions window, Codefresh will automatically connect to your Git provider and fetch your basic account details (such as your email).


## 3. Verify Your Account Details

Once Codefresh reads your details from your Git provider it will present to you the account details for your new account Review your account details, make the relevant changes, and click *SIGN UP*. 

{% include 
image.html 
lightbox="true" 
file="/images/getting-started/create-account/codefresh-signup.png" 
url="/images/getting-started/create-account/codefresh-signup.png" 
alt="Codefresh account details" 
caption="Codefresh account details (click image to enlarge)" 
max-width="40%" 
%}

Congratulations! Your new Codefresh account is now ready.

## Other Git connection options



Codefresh also supports Atlassian Stash/Bitbucket Server. You need to [contact us](https://codefresh.io/contact-us/) to enable this integration before you can use it for your account.
