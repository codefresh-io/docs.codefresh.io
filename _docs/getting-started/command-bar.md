Stay where you are in Codefresh and get to what you want without extra clicks! Be it navigation, actions such as switching accounts, or finding entities such as pipelines or builds, Codefresh Global Search & Navigation is your answer. 



## About Global Search & Navigation

Global Search & Navigation is always available in the toolbar, displayed on the top-left. 

{{site.data.callout.callout_tip}}
**TIP**:  
If you don't see the Global Search field in the toolbar, you may have to [enable the Codefresh New Experience]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/new-codefresh/enable-new-experience/#enable-the-codefresh-new-experience).
{{site.data.callout.end}}

When you click the Global Search field, you can see the predefined categories to jump-start your search for **Pipelines** **Projects**, or **Documentation**. 

To start the search, click a category or directly type in the first letters of what you're looking for. 
Select the option or use the shortcut keys. See [Keyboard shortcuts for Global Search & Navigation](#keyboard-shortcuts-for-global-search--navigation).

>**TIP**:   
The results are synced to your permissions and account settings.

>**NOTE**:  
>The Global Search & Navigation feature establishes an initial handshake request with the data source API on inital loading. The outcome of this request does not impact functionality, even in on-premises or air-gapped environments where it will fail.  
>Although your monitoring or alerting systems may flag it as a failure, you can safely disregard the failure notification.
