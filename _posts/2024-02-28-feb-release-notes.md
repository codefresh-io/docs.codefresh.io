## Features & enhancements

### Pipelines: Blobless Git clone

Here's an enhancement which contributes to workflow optimization -  a new field in our `git_clone` step: the `exclude_blob` field.
Filter out blob files from the Git repository and further streamline your development process. Fewer unnecessary files to clone and faster cloning times!  

For blobless cloning, simply set `exclude_blob` to `true`. To always include blob files, you can retain the default value of `false`.

For details, see [Fields in git-clone step]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/pipelines/steps/git-clone/#fields).

### GitOps: Argo CD application enhancements

We introduced a couple of usability enhancements for Argo CD applications in Codefresh.  

##### Deployment record for Current Release
To more accurately represent the live deployment status of the selected application in the Timeline tab, we now clearly differentiate between current and historical deployments.

The Current Release is prominently displayed as a dedicated deployment record at the top of the Timelines tab, tagged as the Current Version. It is followed by the list of Previous Releases.

alt="Current Release deployment record in Timeline tab"

%}

* To prevent confusion with duplicate statuses, the application's health and sync statuses are now exclusively displayed and tracked within the Application Header. 

* To validate that the current release as the live state, the release revision in the deployment record mirrors the sync revision displayed in Last Sync Result. 

For details, see [Monitoring deployments for selected Argo CD application]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/deployments/gitops/applications-dashboard/#monitoring-deployments-for-selected-argo-cd-application).

##### Quick links
The Configuration tab displays handy links to the application's GitOps Runtime, Git Source, and YAML manifest in the Git repo.

### GitOps: Deprecation of GitOps CLI for Runtime installation

As we have transitioned to Helm-based Runtimes for GitOps, we have permanently deprecated the CLI-based installation for GitOps Runtimes.
