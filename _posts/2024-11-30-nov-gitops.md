## Features & enhancements

### General: Annotate image by name via CLI
Now using the CLI, you can annotate your images also by their names, instead of only the image SHA.


You can easily find and copy the image name from the Images dashboard.

{% include 
   image.html 
   lightbox="true" 
   file="/images/whats-new/nov24/image-name-images-dashboard.png" 
   url="/images/whats-new/nov24/image-name-images-dashboard.png" 
   alt="Copy image name from Images dashboard" 
   caption="Copy image name from Images dashboard" 
   max-width="60%" 
   %}


Here's an example of the CLI command:  
`codefresh annotate image docker.io/codefresh-io/cli:latest -l coverage=75% -l tests_passed=true`

To use this feature, make sure to upgrade to the latest CLI version.

On drill down into the image from the Images dashboard, the OS/Arch column displays digests for each OS architecture.

### GitOps: Display full name for applications

Here's a usability enhancement that's sure to resonate: display full name of applications in the Current State tab of the GitOps Apps dashboard.

If you have naming conventions that result in long application names, easily toggle between displaying the full/truncated application name with a handy button in the
