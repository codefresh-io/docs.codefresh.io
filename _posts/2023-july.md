## Features & enhancements


### Okta with OIDC

**Multi-account sync**

Following the successful implementation of just-in-time provisioning support for Okta, we are taking it a step further by introducing multi-account sync for OIDC-Okta. This exciting feature enables you to synchronize multiple Codefresh accounts in Okta simultaneously in Codefresh, ensuring a seamless SSO setup for enterprise customers.

With multi-account sync, you can easily select additional Codefresh accounts to sync with your Okta OIDC account in Codefresh. Codefresh validates admin privileges and access for each of the selected accounts, guaranteeing secure and reliable authentication. 

You have the flexibility to sync users in multiple ways: through the UI's `Auto-group sync`, perform on-demand synchronization through the CLI, or integrate it into a Codefresh pipeline using the CLI synchronize command.



**Delete users removed during sync**

We added an option to further streamline Okta SSO account and user management in Codefresh. Now, you can easily remove individual users who are deactivated in Okta, not only from the current account but from additional accounts you have defined in your current account. 

The Users list is updated, keeping both the Teams and Users lists always organized .

For details, see [Configure OIDC SSO settings for Okta in Codefresh](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/administration/single-sign-on/oidc/oidc-okta/#how-to). 


### `hastags` mapping for Gerrit
Continuing to extend our support for Gerrit with our latest update. In place of `change hashtags` in Gerrit, you can use Codefresh's `CF_PULL_REQUEST_LABELS` system variable.

For details, see [System variables in pipelines](https://codefresh.io/docs/docs/pipelines/variables/#system-variables).

### Share URL with account info
Introducing the Copy URL Link button: The Copy URL Link button is our latest addition to the Codefresh UIâ€™s toolbar to ensure seamless collaboration.

The URL link includes your account ID, making it easy to share with others in your organization, and practical for recipients to use it.

It's always available whenever you need it in  the Codefresh toolbar. Recipients can choose between switching to your account or staying in their current account.

Stay tuned for more exciting updates!




### GitOps on-premises: MTLS for MongoDB and Redis

On-premises for GitOps supports MTLS (Mutual TLS) for Redis and MongoDB. This enhancement provides enhanced security and encryption capabilities for Redis data communication with Codefresh in on-premises environments. Administrators can customize the level of security according to their requirements. 

For details, see [External MongoDB with MTLS](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#external-mongodb-with-mtls){:target="\_blank"} and [External Redis with MTLS](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/codefresh-onprem/codefresh#external-redis-with-mtls){:target="\_blank"}.
