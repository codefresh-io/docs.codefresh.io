## Features & enhancements

### Tunnel-based hybrid runtimes

Simplify installation without compromising on security with our tunnel-based installation option for hybrid runtimes.  

Tunnel-based runtimes use tunneling for communication between the customer cluster and the Codefresh platform, with the customer cluster initiating the tunneling request. Simply add the flag `--access-mode` with `tunnel` as the value and you have your tunnel-based runtime without an ingress controller.

See:  
* [Tunnel-based runtime architecture]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/runtime-architecture/)  
* [Runtime flags]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops/#runtime-flags)
* [Tunnel-based runtime flags]({{site.baseurl}}/docs/installation/gitops/hybrid-gitops/#tunnel-based-runtime-flags)

### Bitbucket Cloud for hosted runtimes

Hosted runtimes now support Bitbucket Cloud as a Git provider.

### Card view for applications

A scannable Card view offers a new layout for applications in the Applications dashboard.
Quickly scan application information top-down, starting with the health and sync statuses, followed by repo and runtime information, and easy access to the available actions at the bottom of the card.

### More application alerts

We added custom warnings for common scenarios with application deployment to our Errors/Warning panel, that both alert you to the problems and possible actions to resolve them.

**Missing Argo Rollouts controller**  
Applications with rollout resources need Argo Rollouts on the managed cluster to execute rollout instructions and deploy the application.
If the Argo Rollouts controller is missing, you get a warning with the option to install Argo Rollouts on the cluster.  

**Long application sync**  
Application sync can continue indefinitely because of issues with the application that you need to troubleshoot, unrelated to Codefresh.  
A new warning alerts you to sync operations that exceed 30 minutes.  
The View Details option takes you directly to the Sync Results tab with details on the sync job and failed hooks, and the option to terminate the sync, and then troubleshoot the application.

### Hide extraneous resources from Current State views

Streamline Current State views for your application's resources by hiding resources not native to the application.
The Ignore Extraneous filter allows you to hide resources generated by tools, whose sync status _does not_ affect the sync status of the application. `ConfigMap` and `pods` are examples of such resources.  
Once you add the  `IgnoreExtraneous` annotation to the resource, clicking the Ignore Extraneous filter hides the resource from the Current State views.
