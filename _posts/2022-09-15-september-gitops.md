## Features & enhancements

### Enriched application header

Every application includes a header that highlights key information and links to key aspects of the application. For example, you can see both the current sync state and the result of the previous sync operation, with links to pull-out panels including additional details.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-sep22-app-header.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-sep22-app-header.png"
 alt="Application header for selected appplication"
 caption="Application header for selected appplication"
    max-width="80%"
%}

### Refresh and hard refresh to manage applications

Just as you can manually synchronize applications directly in Codefresh, you can now perform Refresh and Hard Refresh for applications.
In the Applications dashboard, both options are available in the context menu of each application. On selecting an application, you can see these options on the top-right next to the Synchronize button.

 alt="Refresh/Hard refresh options for selected application"
 caption="Refresh/Hard refresh options for selected application"
    max-width="80%"
%}

### Click resume indefinitely paused rollouts

Argo Rollouts allows you to pause a rollout indefinitely and resume it manually instead of automatically after a fixed duration. Manually resuming a rollout is generally done through the CLI.
Codefresh provides you the option of resuming an indefinitely paused rollout directly from the Applications dashboard in Codefresh, with a single click.

In the Timelines tab of the selected application, an ongoing rollout that is indefinitely paused displays the pause button. Resuming the rollout is as simple as clicking the pause button.

 alt="Resume indefinitley paused rollout"
 caption="Resume indefinitley paused rollout"
    max-width="60%"
%}

### Custom path for application resources

When creating applications, in addition to changing the name of the manifest, you can now also define the path for the manifest within the Git Source. Use the front slash (/) to add subfolders to the path. The resource is created in the Git Source you select, according to the path you defined.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-sep22-app-yaml-location.png"
 url="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-sep22-app-yaml-location.png"
 alt="Define location for application YAML"
 caption="Define location for application YAML"
    max-width="60%"
%}

### Events tab for applications

In the previous month's release, we added the Events panel displaying successful and events for the application.
For more visibility and easier access, the same Events tab is now displayed with the Current State, Timeline, Services, and Configuration tabs for the selected application.

{% include
 image.html
 lightbox="true"
 file="/images/whats-new/rel-notes-sep22-events-tab.png"

 alt="Events tab for application"
 caption="Events tab for application"
    max-width="60%"
%}
