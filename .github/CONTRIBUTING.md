# Contributing to docs.codefresh.io

Looking to contribute something to docs.codefresh.io? **Here's how you can help.**

Please take a moment to review this document in order to make the contribution
process easy and effective for everyone involved.

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of
the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return,
they should reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue or assessing
patches and features.


## Using the issue tracker

The [issue tracker](https://github.com/codefresh-io/docs.codefresh.io) is
the preferred channel for [bug reports](#bug-reports), and [submitting pull requests](#pull-requests), 
but please respect the following restrictions:

* Please **do not** derail or troll issues. Keep the discussion on topic and
  respect the opinions of others.

* Please **do not** post comments consisting solely of "+1" or ":thumbsup:".
  Use [GitHub's "reactions" feature](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments)
  instead. We reserve the right to delete comments which violate this rule.

## Issues and labels

Our bug tracker utilizes several labels to help organize and identify issues. Here's what they represent and how we use them:

- `docs bug` - Issues for improving or updating our documentation.
- `confirmed` - Issues that have been confirmed.
- `examples` - Issues involving the example templates included in our docs.
- `js` - Issues stemming from our compiled or source JavaScript files.
- `meta` - Issues with the project itself or our GitHub repository.


For a complete look at our labels, see the [project labels page](https://github.com/codefresh-io/docs.codefresh.io/labels).


## Bug reports

A bug is a _demonstrable problem_ that is caused by the code in the repository.
Good bug reports are extremely helpful, so thanks!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** &mdash; check if the issue has already been
   reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** &mdash; try to reproduce it using the
   latest `master` or development branch in the repository.


## Pull requests

Good pull requests—patches, improvements, new features—are a fantastic
help. They should remain focused in scope and avoid containing unrelated
commits.

**Please ask first** before embarking on any significant pull request (e.g.
implementing features, refactoring code, porting to a different language),
otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that the
project's developers might not want to merge into the project.

Please adhere to the [coding guidelines](#code-guidelines) used throughout the
project (indentation, accurate comments, etc.) and any other requirements
(such as test coverage).

Similarly, when contributing to Codefresh's documentation, you should edit the
documentation source files in
[the `/docs.codefresh.io/docs/` directory of the `master` branch](https://github.com/codefresh-io/docs.codefresh.io/tree/master/docs).

Adhering to the following process is the best way to get your work
included in the project:

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the project, clone your fork,
   and configure the remotes:

   ```bash
   # Clone your fork of the repo into the current directory
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/docs.codefresh.io.git
   # Navigate to the newly cloned directory
   cd docs.codefresh.io
   # Assign the original repo to a remote called "upstream"
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/codefresh-io/docs.codefresh.io.git
   ```

2. If you cloned a while ago, get the latest changes from upstream:

   ```bash
   git checkout master
   git pull upstream master
   ```

3. Create a new topic branch (off the main project development branch) to
   contain your feature, change, or fix:

   ```bash
   git checkout -b <topic-branch-name>
   ```

4. Commit your changes in logical chunks. Please adhere to these [git commit
   message guidelines](http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
   or your code is unlikely be merged into the main project. Use Git's
   [interactive rebase](https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/)
   feature to tidy up your commits before making them public.

5. Locally merge (or rebase) the upstream development branch into your topic branch:

   ```bash
   git pull [--rebase] upstream master
   ```

6. Push your topic branch up to your fork:

   ```bash
   git push origin <topic-branch-name>
   ```

7. [Open a Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/)
    with a clear title and description against the `master` branch.

**IMPORTANT**: By submitting a patch, you agree to allow the project owners to
license your work under the terms of the [MIT License](LICENSE) (if it
includes code changes) and under the terms of the
[Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported License](docs/LICENSE)
(if it includes documentation changes).

## Code guidelines

### HTML

[Adhere to the Code Guide.](http://codeguide.co/#html)

- Use tags and elements appropriate for an HTML5 doctype (e.g., self-closing tags).
- Use CDNs and HTTPS for third-party JS when possible. We don't use protocol-relative URLs in this case because they break when viewing the page locally via `file://`.
- Use [WAI-ARIA](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA) attributes in documentation examples to promote accessibility.

### CSS

[Adhere to the Code Guide.](http://codeguide.co/#css)

- When feasible, default color palettes should comply with [WCAG color contrast guidelines](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#visual-audio-contrast).
- Except in rare cases, don't remove default `:focus` styles (via e.g. `outline: none;`) without providing alternative styles. See [this A11Y Project post](http://a11yproject.com/posts/never-remove-css-outlines/) for more details.

### JS

- No semicolons (in client-side JS)
- 2 spaces (no tabs)
- strict mode
- "Attractive"
- Don't use [jQuery event alias convenience methods](https://github.com/jquery/jquery/blob/master/src/event/alias.js) (such as `$().focus()`). Instead, use [`$().trigger(eventType, ...)`](https://api.jquery.com/trigger/) or [`$().on(eventType, ...)`](https://api.jquery.com/on/), depending on whether you're firing an event or listening for an event. (For example, `$().trigger('focus')` or `$().on('focus', function (event) { /* handle focus event */ })`) We do this to be compatible with custom builds of jQuery where the event aliases module has been excluded.

### Checking coding style

Run `npm run test` before committing to ensure your changes follow our coding standards.
