A **Composition**  is a group of containers that define a micro-services based application. It can include all services or sub-set of services.

With Codefresh, you can use a composition to run an environment for testing new features or as part of CI pipeline for **Integration Tests **  

Composition can be created through UI or by using [Docker Compose YAML](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/){:target="_blank"}

The number of compositions you can run is determined by your SLA.
